    "## 1.1 Introduction\n",
    "The Amazon Fine Food Reviews Dataset contains over 500,000 reviews with textual data, ratings, timestamps, and product metadata. This dataset is ideal for sentiment analysis due to its rich textual content and structured ratings."

    "## 1.2 Problem Statement\n",
    "The rapid growth of e-marketplaces like Amazon has led to an enormous amount of customer-generated content,such as product reviews, ratings, and feedback. These reviews contain important information regarding customer feedback, likes, and dislikes that can directly affect business decisions like product improvements, marketing campaigns, and customer reach programs. However, it is not possible to manually analyze millions of reviews due to the vast amount of data and the unstructured nature of textual data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For food business firms, understanding customer sentiment regarding their products is critical to maintaining competitive advantage, product quality improvement, and customer satisfaction. The Amazon Fine Food Reviews Dataset, which comprises over 500,000 food product reviews, presents an opportunity to leverage cutting-edge Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to extract actionable insights from this unstructured text data."

    "2. Product Manufacturers: Food businesses can employ sentiment analysis to identify areas of improvement in their products.\n",
    "3. Marketing Teams: Direct marketing campaigns and customer interaction policies can be informed through sentiment insights.\n",
    "4. Data Scientists: The project can be referenced for deploying sophisticated NLP techniques like BERT and text classification pipelines."

    "1. Create a robust sentiment analysis model using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for classifying customer reviews as positive or negative.\n",
    "2. Examine the performance of non-deep (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Naive Bayes and XGboost) and deep learning models (TextCNN, DistilBERT).\n",
    "3. Address challenges such as class imbalance, high-dimensional text data, and computational efficiency.\n",
    "4. Provide actionable recommendations to businesses based on examining patterns in customer feedback."

    "## 1.6 Limitations\n",
    "1. Sentiment Classification: Automatically classifying reviews as \"positive\" or \"negative\" from text content and matching ratings.\n",
    "2. Class Imbalance: The dataset exhibits a skewed distribution of ratings, with a majority of positive reviews (70% of ratings are 4-5 stars), which may lead to biased model predictions.\n",
    "3. High Dimensionality: Text data is inherently high-dimensional, and preprocessing and feature engineering must be effective processes transforming it into a state suitable for machine learning models.\n"

    "TextCNN shows good overall performance with accuracy 0.82 and weighted F1-score 0.79, reflecting a generally consistent balance between precision (0.78) and recall (0.82). The classification report, however, shows that performance is quite different across classes. Class 2 is notable with high metrics—precision (0.86), recall (0.95), and F1-score (0.90)—implying the model performs extremely well in detecting and correctly classifying instances from this class. Class 1, however, exhibits strong weakness with low precision (0.36), very low recall (0.09), and resultant F1-score of merely 0.15, which represents the inability of the model to classify true occurrences of this class. Class 0 is moderately weak with lower balanced precision (0.65) and recall (0.56), with the resultant F1-score of 0.60. The macro averages—precision (0.63), recall (0.53), and F1-score (0.55)—show the disparity in class-wise performance. The relatively high loss value of 0.5346 also suggests that while the model is overall good, particularly for Class 2, there are some points for improvement, most importantly in enhancing recall for the poorly performing classes like Class 1, potentially through class rebalancing, improved feature representation, or model tuning."

    "The logistic regression model demonstrates excellent performance for the majority class (`Positive`), with high precision (0.84) and recall (0.98), reflecting its ability to accurately identify and predict this majority class, which is comprised of 1,625 samples. The model's performance significantly deteriorates for the minority classes. For `Negative`, the model possesses moderate precision (0.72) but low recall (0.43), reflecting a high false negative rate. The `Neutral` class performs the poorest, with ghastly accuracy (0.31), recall (0.02), and F1-score (0.04), likely due to its minimal size of only 168 cases compared to the dominating number of `Positive`. The macro average F1-score (0.49) and weighted average F1-score (0.78) are measures that indicate the overall bad performance of the model on all classes and hide these issues by assigning significant weight to the majority class. This imbalance reflects the need for techniques such as resampling, class weighting, or employing algorithms more suited to imbalanced data to improve the model's ability to handle minority classes better."
