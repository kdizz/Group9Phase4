24619,B0047E2I5U,A74ZHK7QFVQ29,Art√¨st,1,1,5,1305072000,My Westie loves it!,"I have a 6 year old westie that had the worst food allergies, her coat was very brittle, and she had low energy.  One walk and she'd be passed out.  As many of you on here, I take pride in my dog and pride that I want to take care of it the best that I am able to. I've tried blue buffalo and other high rated foods, but she would not eat them unless I ""spiced"" it up with something. It was time consuming, frustrating, and hard to keep her on an eating schedule.  I finally decided to give this a go ahead even though it is on the pricey side.<br /><br />What I've noticed is that she eats it immediately and even licks her bowl.  Her coat is soft and shiny now, she's a running dog now than a walk dog (and thats saying something considering she's a westie), and her eating schedule is regulated and I have a better idea of what she's eaten so I can control her weight (she's a small westie around 14 lbs.)<br /><br />For those of you thinking that its too expensive there's no way you could afford to keep your dog on this diet. For my dog she requires about 0.75 ounces or 3/4 of a scoop and that goes a long way for a 2.2 lb. bag.  So its not like I am buying this dog food every week.<br /><br />The only small negative is the dog food has a slight smell to it.  Nothing that will make you vomit but its not something I am used to smelling when giving her dog food.  For those wondering what the dog food looks like?  It's like small shredded pieces of dark jerky.<br /><br />Recommendation?  BUY"

49807,B000EUIZ8K,A35842Z8RUHYCQ,Nir@d,1,1,5,1302739200,My first Tazo tea,"One of the most unique teas I've ever tasted. I first started drinking this tea because I wanted to start substituting green tea for coffee. So one day I ventured into my local Starbucks and order a green tea. The barista then served me up this wonderful cup of tea. Curious I read the label hanging out of the cup and began my mission to purchase some of this Zen tea. After a few misses I found a Tazo box at my local pharmacy Duane Reade (which is less of a drugstore and more of a supermarket). The tea that brewed was wonderful and flavorful, but I have to admit, I was a little disappointed. I mistakenly thought that the box of Tazo tea housed the sachets like those I had tried at Starbucks. I would later discover the `tins' (as I call them), which are sold locally at Starbucks (duh).<br /><br />In my opinion both the filter bag and the sachet taste strikingly similar. However, I still favor the sachets as they were my first experience with Tazo.<br /><br />Whoever is the Tea Master at Tazo is doing a superb job at keeping taste very consistent.<br /><br />I brew the Zen tea piping out and let it sit for a while longer than usual. I find that if I let it steep for to short I get too much lemon grass, as it takes a while for the green tea flavors to steep out. It's really an art to balance the complex flavors of this tea, yet well worth the mastery."

I originally bought these organic tomatoes for my stepfather, whose heart disease dictated a low sodium diet. And they are incredibly low in sodium.

The next morning, I had one as a pre-coffee snack. I couldn't have just one at a time and I ate my second one soon after. The refrigerated ones were just as good, if you like your caramels a little harder. Unfortunately, since I scarfed down this bag so fast, my stomach is not happy with me.

Whether it be a rawhide, cow ear, meaty femur or even a stuffed KONG toy.  Dogs that love to chew & can eat a rawhide in a matter of minutes, should not be permitted to have rawhide because they are considered ""aggressive chewers"".  This does not mean that they are mean or naughty dogs, but more that they are persistent.  These dogs should only be allowed to chew on KONG toys or Nylabone (non-flexible) chews.  I have an aggressive chewer myself & those are the only toys he plays with for chewing purposes.<br /><br />I also have a non-aggressive chewer.  He will carry a stuffed toy in his mouth wherever he goes, he's not interested in ripping it to shreds.  He will only chew a rawhide or Nylabone for a few minutes before he gets bored.  Rawhides are safer for these types of dogs because they won't try to eat the piece whole, even still, supervision is a must.<br /><br />Please take into consideration what kind of chewer you have prior to purchasing this product.

It is a bit sweeter and not as rich as real eggnog, unless you mix with cream and milk (the manufacturer recommends mixing with milk). I add a touch of vanilla and nutmeg to the mix, and use it to make eggnog lattes. Delicious, and now I enjoy eggnog lattes year-round. I find that I can make an eggnog latte using this product that tastes more like eggnog than using real eggnog. When mixed with fat free half and half, you can enjoy the taste of eggnog with no cholesterol, no fat, and low carbohydrates. If you mix with regular half-and-half, even creamier. When mixing, let it stand for 10 to 15 minutes before using. No need to mix and let stand overnight, tends to separate out if left sitting overnight."

The texture wasn't right, too chunky, she didn't like the taste, just old persnickity cat tricks trying to make me beg her to eat.  Than I discovered Fancy Feast, at $1.00 per 3 OZ CAN!!!  She LOVED it.  It was a pate', the texture was great and she could actually smell it.  I try to get 2 cans a day in the cat, at pet food store prices, that's $60.00 a month.  We have 3 other cats and a big dog, so that option would'n fly.  So I turned to Amazon.com, and behold, there I found Sara's Fancy Feast for less than 50 cents a can with the SUBSCRIBE and SAVE program.  We're all happy now.  The coolest thing that I noticed about how Fancy Feast affected my Sara, is that her coat is lustrous again.  Sara's coat was getting kinda dull and her grey fur had turned brown and coarse, I just thought that this was due to ageing.  She is now mostly grey, and her fur is soft again. Coincidence?  Maybe, but I like her looking good and being excited about eating again.  Not bad for an old kitty."

I just ordered 4, 27 oz. tubs of the Teenies (we have Papillons) and I know our dogs will enjoy every one of them. Never have to worry about our dogs getting fat eating these as we do not give them multiple times a day. The new formula reportedly has solved the digestibility problem and the manufacturer claims is now more digestible than normal dog food. In the original formula, the problem usually involved incidents when dogs just tried to swallow them whole or get it down in 2 bites. Our dogs always chewed them into small pieces avoiding any problems. Believe me, your dogs will love them."

After a few additional tries I figured out the best way to make the crust. First instead of the 2 tablespoons of oil you will use about 1/4 cup. Don't add it all at once. Instead use your fork to mix the crust and after it is ready to knead you will slowly add the oil till you get a gum like texture. Whatever you are using to cook it on (I use a pizza stone) oil it. When you put the dough on the spread (I do mine by hand) fold it over itself a few times to start it. Then you will move it to the edges. You will have extra dough a the edges but make sure that you get the inner areas as thin as possible. If you do not this will result in the dough not cooking all the way through. You can either remove some of the extra dough around the edges or leave it (I leave mine and I love it). If you leave it, it will rise and it will look like a 14 inch soup bowl or a giant hat. You can season the edges before you cook it for dipping in butter or save the crust for crutons. Im not gonna lie, it took me a few times to figure this out but this is the best result that I have gotten from it and it is GREAT."

I bought a case of Popchips BBQ. These are satisfying and taste great. They don't taste exactly like any full fat chip products I've had mainly because they're not greasy at all, but they have a nice BBQ potato chip flavor. These are thick, crunchy, and light. I first bought the .8 oz bags and this serving size is on the small side for me with lunch (would probably be alright for a snack). 3 of the .8 oz bags works for me which of course bumps up the fat intake, but considering the same volume of ""regular"" chips has much more fat it is a significant fat decrease overall which is what I was looking for. I find the 3 ounce bags to be perfect. Even eating all 3 ounces works out to significantly less fat and calories than eating the same volume of other chips. This makes Popchips very satisfying to me, and I have bought many cases through Amazon.<br /><br />Heads up (mid-2011): Unfortunately the price has gone up significantly for these chips through Amazon, causing me to cancel my subscribe & save subscriptions. Popchips have popped up in local stores for significantly less per ounce. I love the convenience of the portioned bags and subscription but it's hard to justify paying double for the same product.<br /><br />The flavors are pretty straight forward but here's my thoughts...<br />Original flavor: Tastes like a plain potato chip minus the grease. Not my favorite flavor, but good for what it is. This flavor would probably be good with some kind of dip.<br />Chedder: Cheddar quickly became tied with BBQ for my favorite. Like BBQ the cheddar flavor is very strong. Great chips.<br />Salt & Pepper: Very strong pepper. To enjoy these you have to really like pepper. I like them, but they're not a favorite.<br />Sea Salt & Vinegar: I'm not a fan of vinegar, but strangely I enjoy this flavor. They're indeed salty with a fairly strong vinegar flavor."

They quit playing with their other toys and carry these around with them.  I have 2 of the x-small and 1 of the med/large which is really big.  Some of them have a rope and some have a rubber rope.  It seems a little harder to get out treats with the regular rope because of the size of it.  It really makes your dogs work for the treats and keeps them occupied for a long time.  You can even take the rope out and put in a golf ball but the treats do come out easier with this method.  My dogs have slammed these things around and there has been no breakage of the product.  I have 2 German Shepherds so they are pretty tough on toys.  I also like the fact that you can fill these up ahead of time and then give to dogs later when you are leaving.

After experimenting a bit, and reading lots of recipes, I've come up with a simple, yet tasty way to prepare McCANN's Steel Cut Irish Oatmeal. Give it a try, and you may decide that oatmeal can be a healthy and delicious addition to your breakfast menu.<br /><br />Recipe:<br /><br />- Start by bringing 3 cups of water to a boil (about 3 minutes in the microwave).<br />- In a medium saucepot, melt 1 tablespoon of butter then add 1 cup of oats. Toast the oats on medium heat for about 3 minutes.<br />- Add the boiling water to the toasted oats and simmer for 25 minutes. Don't stir. It should get to a soft bubbling simmer.<br />If it boils to hard, you stove is set too hot, so turn it down or it will burn.<br />- Add 1 cup of milk (or can do with a mix of milk and buttermilk).<br />- Cook an additional 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.<br /><br />Makes 4-5 good size servings with excellent texture and consistency. It thickens once it sits a little bit. You can increase or decrease the milk to adjust the consistency as desired. You can also save it for up to a week in the refrigerator without much difference in taste. Just store in small sealed bowls. Each can of McCANNs oatmeal makes about 16-20 servings.<br /><br />Everyone likes to top and sweeten their oatmeal differently (sugar, brown sugar, maple syrup, raisins, etc.). Only add the toppings when you're ready to eat it, not before storing in the refrigerator. For my serving, I like to add 2 tsp of brown sugar, a sprinkle of cinnamon, about 1/2 tbsp of butter, and then top with chopped pecans. Very tasty. Hope you enjoy!<br /><br />Please be kind enough to indicate if reviews are helpful."

A word of warning-don't ever buy cheap (in quality) loose or bagged tea. It will be stems and bits of leaves swept up from the floor-at least that is what it looks and tastes like.

To mask the odor, I began using it mixed with some Earl Grey from Stash.  This worked well and I really enjoy the mix.  However, when I found that Davidson had a Rooibos with a Chai mix, I decided to try that.  I found I liked it very much and didn't notice any unusual odor.<br />Others have commented on the tea being very finely ground and that is true.  I make a lot of ice tea using a West Bend 68303 machine.  It has a very fine screen that should handle Rooibos very well.  However, coffee filters are cheap.  I put in a coffee filter in the tea holder before filling it with tea and that works very well.  Also, it's a snap to clean later for you just dump the filter and grounds all at once.<br />I'm not very good at describing the taste.  I drink about 2 quarts a day of ice tea and can only say I really love the flavor of Masala Chai Rooibos.  I also love Davidson's packaging.  I find myself using this tea every day.  Sometimes I mix a bag or two of something else with it, but it is always the foundation of whatever I brew.  I also sometimes add a flavored sweetener like vanilla or caramel.

We have tried most of the other varieties of Popchips and have our own preferences. My older daughter likes salt and pepper, barbecue, and this flavor the best. I like barbecue, sour cream and onion, and this flavor the best. My wife likes salt and vinegar and this flavor the best. My younger daughter does not like this flavor. She prefers barbecue, cheese, and sour cream and onion. Our least favorite is the original, probably because it is so plain by comparison.<br /><br />To me, Popchips are sort of a cross of potato chips, popcorn, and rice cakes.

Amazon needs to fix the product feature description as it is wrong.<br /><br />Product Features<br />Description: PASTA SCE,CRMY TOMATO RC Quantity: 6 Size: 19.6 OZ Brand: LUCINI<br /><br />The ""Quanity: 6"" is not correct.

The popcorn doesn't come out the same as when I make it on the stove but it is good nonetheless (a diff type of good) plus much less hassle.  I was worried when I read other reviews about the ""stale"" taste and oil...I didn't have any of that.

Needless to say, I wanted to make sure he got to eat a cupcake too, but I didn't want to buy a bunch of weird flours and get stuck with the excess.<br /><br />One box didn't make 12 cupcakes like the box said, although if you don't fill the cupcake cups up, i'm sure you could get 12 out of the mix.  I like to fill my cupcakes a little fuller though, for aesthetics, so I ended up using both boxes to make about 18 cupcakes.<br /><br />The flour mixture itself was very fluffy and well sifted, which always makes for a nice cake consistency.  I didn't use the box directions, and instead used the weight watchers reecipe using orange soda and egg whites instead of eggs and butter.  The vanilla flavor wasn't completed covered up by the soda, so I imagien in a vanilla preparation it would taste pretty good.  The only off-putting part was when the cupcakes came out of the oven, they smelled a bit liek corn muffins.  but by the time they were frosted and decoarted, I didn't notice the corn smell.<br /><br />For the frosting packet, I used the butter and milk as described, but added orange flavoring to go with the orange soda cupcakes.  I think the buttercream mix was basically just confectioner's sugar that was processed without gluten 9since I think alot of corn starch used in regular powdered sugar is processed with wheat).  It didn't make very much frosting though.  Both packets together wouldnt have covered 24 cupcakes, but since I only ended up with 18 it came out perfectly.<br /><br />I made the cupcakes the night before they'd be served,  and the next day they were a little gummy, but not really much worse for the wear.  If I made these again, I'd probably store them covered on the counter, then frost the day of to keep them from getting gummy in the fridge.<br /><br />All in all, they got the job done - without any reactions(!) and all the 'normal' eaters still liked them!"

I tried baking something simliar and couldn't do it -- though when I have mroe time, I'll give it many more tries. So just a couple days ago, I ordered a 16 pack box or cinnamon, sugar, and now I'm trying for the first time the oatmeal. I do recommend these cookies; they are my afternoon treat -- one pack of cookies (only 120 calories) and a good cup of decaf coffee and I'm fine till dinner!"

I actually really liked the taste of it. Unlike your typical sodas, this drink did not have the lingering carbonated fizz and I didn't get any disgusting soda burps after drinking it. You know the kind I mean, when you burp and anyone within 20 or 30 yards of you is running for fresh air. I also didn't get any real aftertaste when drinking it either.<br /><br />Now coming in at 8.3 ounces, the calories in this drink are reported at 135 calories per can. By comparison, a 12 ounce can of Pepsi comes in at 150 calories per can. So, on the calorie front I wouldn't say that there is much of a difference between this drink and Pepsi, although if you do the math, this drink would actually have more calories than Pepsi if you compared them in equal amounts. However, if you look at the list of ingredients in both, you can see where this product is far better for you than your traditional sodas, although obviously not as good for you as drinking an actual 100% pure fruit or vegetable juice.<br /><br />To put in plainly and succinctly, this is a really good tasting beverage and is definitely one I would consider drinking over the more traditional sodas that are currently available. However, the one primary detractor to this is the size of the can compared to the price.<br /><br />The one thing that I had not quite decided on whether it is a negative or a positive is the size of the can, which as I stated earlier comes in at 8.3 ounces compared to your traditional cans of soda that come in at 12 ounces. In addition to the size of the can, there is also the consideration of price, coming in at roughly $1.00 per can which is considerably more expensive than your average can of soda. Therefore, when you take the size of the product combined with the price, I would have to say that it is a definite negative, although this one tasted so good to me that I will definitely be purchasing this product.<br /><br />Shawn Kovacich<br />Creator of numerous books and DVD's."

If you like your coffee fully flavorful and delicious, but not too robust or bold, this coffee is for you.

23663,B001E5DYSK,A14Q5D3QYA8FPV,Shopper,3,3,5,1246665600,Only ILLY for this filly ;-P...,"The Illy company was set up in 1933 in Italy by a Hungarian officer who had come to Trieste with the Austro-Hungarian Army during World War I, and stayed. Today, the company remains with the Illy family, with the founder's grandson at the helm. They have 700 employees and sell their brand in over 100 countries. The company uses only Arabica beans, purchased directly from the farmer, rather then the middleman, and produces only one superiour blend.<br /><br />So much for Google info ;o)... Now, here is my personal Illy ""journey"":<br /><br />I am down to only one cup of coffee a day and so I need its taste to be perfect (quality vs quantity). I like my coffee very strong, but dread the bitter aftertaste many strong brands induce (Starbucks would be one). I was introduced to Illy by a co-worker a few years ago, and have not looked back... It provides the strength I crave, with a sweet and smooth aftertaste. Yes, this coffee will grow hair on your chest(figuratively...). The coffee is packed in air free conditions (with nitrogen gas), to help preserve the taste. When you pull of the inner metal seal, you will hear the air hissing its way into the can. The metal cap is a twist off. It is designed to be air tight as well, to prolong the freshness after the can has been opened.<br /><br />Regarding the brewing process: for a decade now I have been using the French press exclusively (I believe it delivers a stronger/sweeter brew). I find the medium grind/medium roast ""blue band"" Illy to be perfect for the purpose. The instructions on the back of the can help you with coffee to water ratio for both the drip machine and the French press. Do not over-agitate the French press after brewing and you will be ok. Alternately, you may purchase whole Illy beans and grind them to your satisfaction (sadly, I am too lazy for that...).<br /><br />Regarding Amazon price and service: Illy is not easy to find in certain parts of the country. Where I live, it requires a trip to the local mall... So, I was happy to find that Amazon offered this product at the same price as my mall, with the cost free, directly to my door, service. The item arrived promptly, with the ""open by"" date fourteen months away. I am a happy customer!<br /><br />I hope the coffee will work for you as well!"

I do like how you can select either a small or large cup with this unit and I like how the water tank is dishwasher safe.

These are all non-caffeine, high antioxidant herbal teas that are always startling delicious to anyone I have served them too.<br /><br />Wissotzky makes a whole range of teas, including those with black tea and those with green tea. The ones I discuss here are my personal favorites.<br /><br />Wissotzky Teas are rather renowned though, personally, I hadn't heard of them until I was teaching at my University's summer law program at University of Haifa in Israel. You pick them up at any supermarket there -- but you have to special order them over here in the US.<br /><br />Having to live in dormitory-style living while teaching over there, the tea was convenient but I was most startled by how really delicious it was. I am not a big tea drinker -- occasionally herbal tea in the winter -- but I was drinking this tea every day during the very hot Israeli summer.<br /><br />I brought quite a bit back with me and ordered more here. I often offered it to colleagues during meetings in my office and they were invariably struck by how unexpectedly delicious it is.<br /><br />So now I give boxes as gifts. And the recipients often hint they wouldn't mind another gift they so love it.<br /><br />Serving the tea at one of my group work meetings has become a hallmark tradition and puts a positive tone as we launch into a 3 hour work session.<br /><br />For more information:<br />These herbal teas are made from the Rooibus (Red Bush) plant from South Africa.<br /><br />The only authentic Rooibus tea is from South Africa -- though many companies claim theirs is Rooibus though not from South Africa.<br /><br />It is not unlike that genuine Champagne can only come from the Champagne region of France but firms market sparkling wines from other regions prepared by the ""Methode Champenoise."" In that case, there are excellent Methode Champenoise sparkling wines that rival genuine Champagne (though being a champagne lover -- I still find a taste unique to genuine Champagne.)<br /><br />However my experience is that non-South African Rooibus Tea is not as good nor does it have the medicinal and homeopathic qualities that genuine Rooibus tea does.<br /><br />As to the variations: Wissotzky sells the pure Rooibus Tea (which does not seem to be here on Amazon) and 3 flavored versions: 1. with Chamomile, Lime & Honey,[[B0041R1UM0 Wissotzky Red Tea with Chamomile, Lime & Honey, 1.41-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)]] (my and most people's favorite)  2. with Cinnamon & Vanilla <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0041R00WG"">Wissotzky Red Tea with Cinnamon and Vanilla, 1.41-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>(my second most favorite and many people's first choice) and 3. with Rosehip & Passion Fruit <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0041R1DYA"">Wissotzky Red Tea with Rosehip and Passion fruit, 1.41-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> (which I also really like and again is some people's favorites.)<br /><br />As mentioned at the start of this review -- Wissotzky makes a whole range of teas, both with and without flavors, herbal, black tea and green tea (which has its own homeopathic benefits.) I've tried many of the other herbal and enjoy them; I personally stay away from caffeine as my system doesn't handle it well."

First of all, these bars are fairly nutritious. They are made of natural ingredients and whole grains, just like the cereal. Each bar contains 6g of fiber and 9g of protein. Considering most people in the United States don't get enough fiber, that is a very decent amount. Previously I was eating the Fiber One Bars Oats & Chocolate, 5-Count Boxes (Pack of 12). While you get 3g more fiber in those bars, you only get 2g of Protein. The Kashi bars are made of better (and more nutritious) ingredients, and they taste better as well. Each bar has only 180 calories, but they are very filling due to the fiber and protein.<br /><br />Although a bar made of brown rice and oats doesn't sound very tasty, these are some of the best bars I've tried.

This half pound package of beans that comes in a vacuum pack contains at least 50 beans and cost only $25.

Until recently, one of these advantages was that it contained DHA and ARA, fatty acids that are important components of brain structure.<br /><br />Recently, manufacturers have begun adding DHA and ARA to their infant formula.  Some studies have indicated that addition of DHA and ARA to formula provides an advantage of 6-7 IQ points over normal formula, nearly as much as the IQ point advantage of breast fed babies.<br /><br />However, the DHA and ARA added to infant formulas are chemically extracted from certain species of algae and mold using solvents, and are not identical to the DHA and ARA found in breast milk.  There have also been reports that the DHA and ARA supplemented formula causes diarrhea in some children.  In our daughter, it seemed to cause softer and messier stool, though it wasn't quite diarrhea.<br /><br />Baby's only DHA and ARA is extracted from egg yolks using a water based process, and thus may avoid some small risk associated with the solvent extracted versions.  It's mixed into formula that isn't fortified with DHA and ARA or into other foods.  We use it with Baby's Only toddler formula, and it does not cause messy stool with our daughter.<br /><br />Breast feeding is still better than any formula, of course - it has other advantages, such as a protective effect against infections that the formula makers haven't figured out yet.  However, if you must formula feed for some reason - for us, my wife's pumping at work didn't keep up with the baby's demand, and eventually we also had to stop breast feeding to try to start a second baby - mixing Baby's Only DHA and ARA supplement into a nonsupplemented formula is probably the next best thing."

My vet suggested that we put him on a limited ingredient diet that cut out corn and other grains and instead used potatoes as the carbohydrate source. Natural Balance LID Potato & Duck Formula worked quite well for us, but we could tell that our pug was looking for some variety so we tried their Sweet Potato and Venison formula.<br /><br />According to the Natural Balance web site, some dogs develop sensitivities to commonly used proteins, carbohydrates, and food additives. This may cause stomach and intestinal problems, as well as skin irritations. In our dog's case, it was his red irritated skin on his belly that led us to try a limited ingredient diet. The Natural Balance Sweet Potato and Venison formula combines fresh venison, a source of animal protein that most dogs have not been exposed to, and sweet potato, premium quality carbohydrate rich in potassium and a highly digestible energy source. Other key ingredients include canola oil, low in saturated fat and high in monounsaturated fat, as well as an excellent source of Omega-3 and Omega-6 fatty acids, along with flaxseed, another quality source of Omega-3 fatty acids. The food is completely grain free (no barley, wheat, rice or corn) and contains no artificial colors or flavors.<br /><br />The kibble is a small oval-shaped disk. It's fairly flat and measures just a hair over half an inch wide. My pug is able to eat it easily, although in his case, he pretty much inhales his food and doesn't chew it much. It has a slight meaty smell, which I think he likes, as the Potato and Duck formula didn't seem to have much of an enticing scent.<br /><br />My local specialty pet food store tells me this is #1 selling dog food. I can see why! Our pug continues to do well with this LID formula, just like he did with Potato & Duck. His skin shows no sign of redness and irritation, and just as importantly, it appears to agree well with his stomach. He doesn't get gassy and his stool is not loose or showing any other signs of intestinal distress. It also appears to keep his appetite under control as he doesn't beg for so many treats between meals and doesn't start asking for dinner so early as he did with some other foods in the past. If it keeps him happy and itch-free, then we're happy, too. 5 stars."

I cannot stay on a diet if I feel deprived. WW's website had a coupon for these pricey chips.  Never had a ""popped"" chip before, so I gave it a whirl.<br /><br />Wow, the best crunch and flavor of all reduced-calorie chips I have ever tried.  Better than other brands' popped chips I have tried since.  I need portion control help and these little bags for 3 points do it for me.  The variety pack helps to break up any monotony.  My favorite flavor is the BBQ.  I am not a vinegar kinda guy.  The Salt and Vinegar flavor tastes like feet to me.  Love the rest of the flavors.  I love salt, so the saltiness is just right for me.  Thank goodness my blood pressure is not an issue.  I need these snackies.<br /><br />Lost 30 pounds so far in 3 months eating these.

Modern technology has enabled us to produce the epitome of snack foods in a hot, fresh version.  I will be relegated no more to the listless depths of popped corn.  Pork rinds are the ultimate man chips. Very similar to microwaved popcorn, you just shake the bag and put em in your microwave for about 2 min and voila, hot fresh pork rinds.  When you pop them you have to get accustomed to the fact that they don't ""pop"" like popcorn - they just crackle a bit.  So it is a bit hard to tell when they are done and usually through trial and error you will get the perfect time depending upon the type of microwave oven you use.  Mine is 900W and takes just under 2 min. A couple of pieces will get burnt, or as I affectionately refer to as char. The bag will inflate slightly.  When they are done, you open it up and you are greeted with an aroma that is bacon heaven.  Put one in your mouth right away and it will stick to your tongue like a live octopus.  They are a bit salty so they make the perfect accompaniment to a nice cold beer.  I didn't find them too spicy, just enough.  If you want to be creative, you can throw em in a bowl right after they are done popping and throw some salsa verde or any other kind of salsa you have.  You will be greeted with a chorus of wonderful snaps like getting sizzling rice soup at a Chinese restaurant.  Throw on some shredded cheese and the result is ""man nachos"".  My wife thinks that it is utterly disgusting, even though that hasn't stopped her from eating them.  Trust me, they are delicious, but don't let em sit too long or they get soggy."

I still probably prefer white tea more, but this blend is lovely, and lower in caffeine (the red tea has no caffeine, the white tea a bit). This tea contains only South African rooibos (another word for red tea) and white tea.<br /><br />The package says that it contains a hint of sweetness, and I'd agree, although the taste is very hard to describe (if you've had red tea before then you understand). The package also says that this tea is full of ""potent antioxidants"", which of course is very healthy.<br /><br />I would highly recommend Stash's Fusion Red & White Tea unless you do not care for rooibos or white tea; otherwise you will enjoy this.<br /><br />Recommended.<br />*****"

I have tried Solid Gold Hund N' Flocken, DVP's Natural Balance, Costco Kirkland Super Premium, Eukanuba FP Prescription Diet, and Hills ZD Ultra Allergen Free Prescription Diet.<br /><br />I was able to source the Canidae and the Solid Gold foods locally for my Dal with serious allergies.  Both of the foods have had better results than the super pricey prescription diets.  I am sold on Candidae.  I pay $[...] for the 40 LB sack, which is not that bad considering I am sourcing it locally on the Tokyo economy.  The dogs love this food more than the Solid Gold, but I believe that they are both fine foods.  This food looks tastier than the Solid Gold Wolf Pup that I was feeding my K9 German Shepherd, and it seems heartier that the Hund N' Flocken as well.  It just looks like it must taste good.  The dogs go nuts over it like a crack addiction!  I am very happy that I have found a solution that is applicable to both dogs!<br /><br />There is something to be said of companies that go the extra mile for our man's best friend.

Unlike most of the rice (with pasta usually cut in) dishes on the market, you can really smell it cooking from a room away, and when you first open the foil package the mix is kept in to stay fresh, you get a blast of the spices as well.

Like the Chicken Shake and Bake, the shaking bag is no longer included, but it's easy enough to use a Ziploc bag or put the Shake and Bake in a dish and coat your pork with it.  It bakes up quickly and keeps your pork fairly juicy.  To get the whole pork chop crispy, bake on a wire rack or crinkle your foil before putting the pork chop on top - if you place the pork chop directly on the pan, you may end up with a soggy bottom, due to the juices leaking out.

27572,B000FK52B2,A94EJ4NMTPHT0,F. Webb,71,71,5,1165449600,A great option for vertical sprouting,"These smaller sized Sprout Master sprouters are great for smaller batches of leafy sprouts or bean sprouts. The optional tray dividers makes it easy to make small batches of as many as six different sprouts at a time. The larger tray would be better for big batches, but using these trays in concert can achieve the same effect. For most people (not feeding too large a family), I would suggest starting out with these and evaluating whether you often want to make larger batches than you can manage in a single smaller tray.<br /><br />There are four ""lids"" that come with this set and are all exactly the same. Put one below to catch any water and use the one on top if you want to block off light (this helps prevent the growth of green leaves, which is usually how bean sprouts are grown).  With four lids and three trays you'll find it necessary to stack the trays if you want to cover more than one at a time. The Sprout Master's drainage holes allow excess water to drain off very effectively.<br /><br />If you've sprouted in a jar before, you'll probably find this to be much easier. Hold the tray under running cool water two or three times a day, then allow excess water to run off before putting the tray away. The sprouts should be thoroughly rinsed to prevent spoilage, kept moist at all times, but not allowed to sit in water. (By comparison, with jar sprouting you'd need to fill and drain the jar of sprouts repeatedly to rinse the sprouts well, then it's more difficult to get them properly drained.)<br /><br />One minor complaint is that some of the smallest seeds can get caught in the drain holes. In my experience, broccoli is large enough to be safe, but with alfalfa or clover you might get a few seeds stuck. When you're cleaning the tray after use you may need to get a small poking instrument to knock one or two out again. The ""Easy Sprouter"" device doesn't have this problem, but allows slightly less light to reach your sprouts because of it's shape. Neither is a very significant complaint, and I find that the Easy Sprouter gets sufficient light for most purposes."

This is the only brand of dog food he's eaten without making a fussy face. I'm sold!<br /><br />We had him on Royal Canin for about 2 months until we came across Bil Jac. Originally, it was a freebie from our pet supply store. I put it right next to his Royal Canin and the answer was obvious. He loved it. And why wouldn't he? It's made of real chicken and chicken organs, which provides a natural source of fat.<br /><br />I went through the ingredient list and did my own research. Arginine plays an important role in cell division, the healing of wounds, removing ammonia from the body, immune function, and the release of hormones. I went a bit further and asked my vet. He told me that puppies less than 1 year old are unable to create arginine internally, and although it's not an essential amino acid, it's always a good idea to include it in a puppy's nutrition.<br /><br />Bil Jac is slow cooked for over 40 minutes, and that ensures more nutrients are retained during the process. And the fact that there's no sprayed-on fat, corn gluten meal, wheat gluten meal, or less expensive proteins sold me.<br /><br />My vet approved. My budged approved. Most importantly, my puppy gave it the paws up. I'm sticking with Bil Jac all throughout his adult years!"

My puppy absolutely adores these liver treats - our dog trainer calls them ""puppy heroin"". With these treats, training becomes an absolute snap, since the puppy is willing to do anything for his smelly liver treat - and you will have his undivided attention during the entire training session.<br /><br />These liver treats come in cubes and slices about a half inch on each side. I slice them thinly three or four time lengthwise, and then again two or three time crosswise. The liver treats fracture easily, and the taste is so addicting that only the tiniest slivers are necessary to reinforce good puppy behavior. These treats are also low fat and low preservatives, so they are very healthy for your puppy and that makes them even more perfect for training. Really, once you try this treat, you will never need another!<br /><br />As always, purchase and shipping from Amazon was easy and painless, and the liver treats were packed carefully enough that there was no extra treat breakage - which is remarkable for dried treats.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardoll"

The dog food was also ""highly recommended"" by an independent dog food advisor site that I use.<br /><br />My dogs really (really) like this food and they eat as soon as I put it down (even their morning meal which is dry food only), so the taste of this food must really be to their liking.  Despite the fact my dogs are rescues (and who knows what they were eating when they were wildly roaming the streets), they are picky and with the Nature's Variety, half the time they never ate their breakfast.  Also, I have large dogs but for some reason they like the small dry kibble and this is kibble is on the smaller side.<br /><br />I have also noticed a positive change in their stool.  It is a little firmer and a bit smaller, meaning they are absorbing more and eliminating less.<br /><br />I actually really liked Nature's Variety while they were eating it but so far I think the switch was a very good one.<br /><br />****PRICE INCREASE UPDATE: I AGREE WITH THE OTHER REVIEWER THAT THE PRICE INCREASE EFFECTIVE IN THE PAST WEEK IS AN ISSUE AS THE PRICE FOR THIS FOOD HAS ESSENTIALLY DOUBLED.

It took a couple days of playing tug of war and leaving the tug a jug on the floor before he really knew it was ""his"".  Once I finally got him used to realizing it was his own, he saw me put his kibble in it.  Then it took a little bit before he was able to figure out how to work it.  Granted, the interactive part is you helping your dog realize the toy's value.  Now, it is something that can occupy him for 20-25 minutes. He'll do anything for treats.  Although, I'm not sure that he really, really likes it but he focuses in on it until every kibble disappears. I think that it is good for him and makes him do something different to get treats.  I like interactive toys :)<br /><br />On the other hand, our little dog, still doesn't know how to get the treats out or how to use this toy.  Just a guess, he probably never will figure it out.

We tried several Kong type products and he was able to either get his food out too quickly or grew bored and never ate. This toy makes him really work for his food and because he can see the food through the tube it really keeps his interest. My only gripe is that the plastic tube could be more sturdy. I love that it's see through but his jaws of steel have already done some damage to it, but perhaps we just need to experiment with a larger size (we have the small now) We've only had it a short time so I can't speak too much for longevity but for now it is an amazing solution."

Well, because...we have 3 dogs (2 were unplanned children ;-) & our 60-LB German Shepherd AND our 40-LB we-have-no-clue-what-she-is dog have both choked on various shapes & sizes of rawhides. The Shepherd choked so badly that, this time, it wouldn't come up. She couldn't cough & started to literally choke to death. I actually straddled her back, attempting the only thing I  knew how to do - the human Heimlich Maneuver! Like where exactly is a dog's sternum, anyway? Well, I tried anyway and thank God it finally did dislodge & we got it out! Was it the Heimlich? I don't know. Probably not. I mean, she still won't tell me... After all, I guess it was very traumatic for her.<br /><br />But in all seriousness, what I do know, is that was the last time any of my dogs have had any kind of regular rawhide bones! Which, I really wanted to let everyone know of my personal experiences; I believe anybody who is at all concerned about giving their dogs rawhides and/or experiencing a similar problem is on the right track to avoid them.<br /><br />Our small part Chihuawa/part something else, first 2 times in-a-row, threw up repeatedly w/rawhide pieces and w/foam. He was VERY sick the 3rd time, so we definitely stopped that! The ONLY kind I did finally take a chance with were granulated rawhide munchy sticks, & they're all fine w/these; though I'm still nervous about them choking on a piece, but neither of them have had any problems with Boodas so far, & they don't swell up in their throats like regular rawhides.<br /><br />So, now... It's Booda Bones!<br /><br />Yes, they are a bit on the pricey side, especially for my 2 larger aggressive chewers. I agree with some other reviewers that they are not very long-lasting. But it's all I'll give them now. But, for my half Chihuahua/half something else(20lbs), I give him the smallest ones and they are like mega-saurus bones for him(it is my hope that the manufacturer will start selling these in bulk packages, for less $). I get 3 different sizes for my 3 different whatever-they-are-dogs. They absolutely love them! This includes the assorted flavors, the bacon-flavored, and the yogurt-flavored. Whichever is cheaper at the time and shipped by Amazon.<br /><br />And I owe a big thank you to Brian Amazon, all of you for all of your reviews, Booda Bones, and Amazon!<br /><br />** Confession: This was originally a comment I posted to a reviewer by the name of ""Brian Amazon"" a long time ago.

I've read people reviews and they said there were small brown pieces that were hard, that means they were not cooked long enough.  The best way to cook these are to use a medium size pan, pour the pack into the pan and shake it around and bake them in the oven @ 400 degrees for 4-6 minutes, keep a close eye on them because they burn easy.  But it is worth it to cook it in the oven, very hot and fresh and no uncooked curls.  They will appear to be brown at first but they ""poof"" up in the oven once they're heated.  I would say do not microwave these in a bag, use a oven safe plate, that way you can actually see them puff up, older/cheap microwaves can take 4-6 minutes to cook."

My dog arrived with coccidia and giardia as a puppy.  Through veterinary mismanagement, he was never completely healthy for the first 2 1/2 years of his life.  After watching him get sicker on an aggressive course of antibiotics and prednisone for his Inflammatory Bowel Disease, I took him to a holistic veterinarian.  Part of his treatment has been a homemade diet of Sojo's and meat plus no medications.  I'm extremely pleased to report he has had no GI episodes in over 6 months and has reached a point where I consider him healthy.  His coat is glossy and much fluffier than before he's finally at a good weight.  I have before and after photos that show a dramatic improvement,much of which I credit to Sojo's.<br /><br />It does take some extra time to prepare as opposed to kibble, but I make 4 days worth at a time. This takes me about 30 - 40 minutes total which includes down time while the meat is cooking and cleaning up after.  To be completely honest, I'm not thrilled about cooking for my dog but I am thrilled with the results.  If I was able to feed him raw (perhaps down the road, when our vet gives the ok), preparation time would  be almost nothing."

Also, it's organic.<br /><br />You have to hand it to the folks at Newman's Own, they not only find great products, but they do wonderful work in the world. Paul Newman left a legacy that is far larger than his films: he left the world with a dose of great humanity.<br /><br />That said: The Vine newsletter said this would be 12 bars, I got one. When I wrote and asked why, I got a typical runaround from some ""customer service"" employee (I think they need to rename this people something that better reflects what they really do which is to, as we said in the 60's, shine you on) who gave me the company line. In other words, our mistake, tough luck.

(With no Soybean con attached!!),"The first sip gave a pleasing kiwi flavor burst with a light tang of carbonation.  When testing the black cherry flavor, I had placed the can in the freezer for a short period, since I prefer drinks to be ice cold or hot; I didn't want lukewarm to get in the way of a positive response to the first sip.  As the drink warmed a bit, the sweetness overtook the carbonation, which is inevitable in a carbonated beverage, yet, due to the purity of the fruit base, the flavor remained true and welcome.<br /><br />This time, I just had the drink chilled perfectly for me, no ice crystals.  I like the kiwi even better than the cherry!  The kiwi has more tang.  See below (or on the product description on the buying page) for the juice blends used.  I've noticed that most juices currently have apple and grape included, likely because those are cheaper to produce.<br /><br />The way the drink was promoted wasn't a lie!  It worked for me:<br /><br />1. ""100 % of what you want.  0% of what you don't want.""<br /><br />2. ""Make The Switch to a great tasting, all natural beverage that's the perfect balance between JUICE and CARBONATION.""<br /><br />3. The logo has ""THE"" placed upside-down and reversed, atop ""Switch,"" with a swirl designed around the words, the swirl imitating the symbol for reversing something.<br /><br />4. The ingredients read: ""100% juice (filtered sparkling water sufficient to reconstitute juice concentrates, apple, grape, kiwi, acerola* [I added the asterisk; see below] and raspberry and strawberry juice concentrated), natural flavors, ascorbic acid (vitamin C)""<br /><br />5. 100% juice carbonated.<br /><br />6. The can is smaller than the norm for soda pops, which I also liked, because when I used to drink sodas regularly, I usually opened a can and left half of it to get too warm (and fizzed out), so the remainder went down the drain (after I returned it to the fridge for a few days hoping I might drink it).  I drank the whole can of Black Cherry!<br /><br />I decided I liked the near slush state of a short stint in the freezer... leaving it too long, though, might cause too much separation of the fruit concentrate from the fizz water... and, of course, makes it undrinkable from the can until it melts enough to flow through the hole in the top.<br /><br />In the past, when I had begun wanting something more natural than most soda beverages (with phosphates, etc., added), I had used frozen orange juice concentrate added to Club Soda or Ginger ale.  It didn't take long to feel that the process was too much trouble (and it was more expensive than the cost of the Switch product).  Also, I like the types of fruits Switch is using.<br /><br />At first I was confused at the acerola* ingredient, not knowing what it was.  Since my <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00154JDAI"">Kindle 2: Amazon's New Wireless Reading Device (Latest Generation)</a> was at hand, as always, I looked up acerola in the onboard dictionary.  The word wasn't in there, so I pushed the curser to the right, on the arrow for more types of searches, and used my standby, Google, and found several listings of acerola.<br /><br />Briefly, I found that it's thought to have originated from the Yucatan, and is known as Barbados cherry or wild crape myrtle, a tropical fruit-bearing shrub.  Reading into the variety of praiseworthy qualities of that cherry, I was impressed!  It has 32 times the amount of vitamin C as Orange juice, and many other healthful assets.  If you're interested in details, feel free to go Google.<br /><br />I'm beginning to think that many of the flavors available from Switch will include equally intriguing tropical fruits.  (I was glad to see that the Kiwi flavor also has acerola in it).<br /><br />Though the can is appealing and fine, this beverage is good enough to deserve a designer bottle to appeal to the gourmet crowd who want flavor without true health issues... don't get me started on the myriad of heavy promotions of pseudo health issues.  I have a book in progress to be published on KINDLE, which will debut with steam hissing out of Kindle's ears, at no extra charge!  (I'll add a comment to this review about why I had quit drinking soda pops, which will explain why I will be happily able to welcome Switch into my diet.)<br /><br />My thanks to THE SWITCH for providing a healthy, gourmet quality drink... WITHOUT, thank God, SOYBEANS added!!<br /><br />I'm hooked!<br /><br />Linda Shelnutt<br />Author of several Kindle books and Amazon Shorts"

I would honestly probably never have taken a risk on purchasing this treat (as opposed to getting a review sample for free) due to the price, because I'd have assumed there was such a slim chance my dog would agree to eat them. It turns out, though, that she thinks they're fantastic. She gets the same slightly crazed look when you offer her these that she gets for a chunk of hamburger.<br /><br />They suggest that you can crumble them over kibble to make it more appealing, but that bit didn't seem to have much effect on her.

Great for brewing a cup at a time with an infuser or for larger amounts with my TeaDrop. Loose leaf tea is very economical even for premium brands compared to tea bags. Bulk loose tea is also typically better than the powdered teas used for tea bags. Stash is a leading organic tea brand. You can also make any amount using a method common in India by adding the tea leaves into roiling boil water in a pot on the stove for a 3-7 minutes (to taste) and then using a strainer to remove the tea leaves. Longer boiling makes darker tea, but any tea can also become more bitter if boiled longer or too long this way. It is also not advisable to leave the tea leaves in the tea after boiling for the same reason. Use a timer and boil a test batch. Dip a ladle and pour through a strainer into tasting cups at one minute intervals. Set them aside and taste test after finished. Choose your preferred time and strength for future use.

I decided to start drinking green tea due to its purported benefits of prevention of breast cancer, which runs rampant in my family.  I have to drink a decaf product, which is unfortunate as some of the beneficial properties of green tea are removed with the caffeine.  After some research, I found out that there are several ""natural"" methods of decaffeination and that one involves actually using ""natural"" but not necessarily safe chemicals.  Probably the safest method is a process which involves using carbon dioxide.  I emailed Stash about this product and within an hour received a very informative, personalized email describing the process they use, which is the CO2 process and the best as not only does it not use chemicals, but the antioxidant properties of green tea are diminished less with this process than others.  Since I am drinking green tea solely for the health benefits and not the taste, that is important to me.  I think it tastes great for a decaff tea.  It is not strong and has a mild slightly bitter taste.  I add a little peppermint tea and honey to it and it is super tasty.

Right in the heart of the Midwest. I'm sure from farm fields around the area. Great to see a health snack made right here from local sources.<br /><br />Give these a try. I'm sure you will enjoy them as much as my bride and I.<br /><br />Update: The price has gone up from 16.98/12 and found they are selling for 1.00 at Menard's up here in the midwest. Walmart was at 1.68 ea. Great product but might want to shop around for the best price. Prime is a good deal if the price is fair. Over 20.00/12 seems bit too high for me."

42591,B006C6S3QY,A191NJEU1NDZZ0,R. L. Ayers,0,0,5,1349740800,Like crack.  Only good for you.,"I've been experimenting with homemade sugar-free chocolate for a while now, and after trying a large number of sugar substitutes, I've found it very difficult to make anything that I'm proud of.  Chocolate, in general, is very temperamental.  It has six different crystalline forms, and you have to get the temperature just right or else you wind up with a less than desirable form.  And your sugar substitute needs to be fat-soluble and anhydrous, because small amounts of water can will cause your chocolate to seize.  It's very complicated, and I've never been keen on anything I've made myself.<br /><br />Coco Polo's chocolate, by contrast, is tempered perfectly.  It has just the right snap and mouth-feel.  Because it's flavored with Stevia and Erythritol (the easiest-on-your-stomach sugar alcohol), you can eat the whole bar in one sitting and not suffer any unpleasant effects.  At least I didn't.  Everyone is different.  But I can say that even small amounts of malitol-sweetened chocolate cause me gastric upset.<br /><br />That being said, this product is not as sweet as ordinary sugared chocolate.  But that is going to be true of any sugar-free chocolate.  In particular, Coco Polo's sweetness is also somehow more subtle, which is the best I can explain it.  If your familiar with Stevia as a sweetener in tea and coffee, you'll know what I'm talking about.  It's not as intense as sugar, but it's still nice and doesn't have any chemical aftertaste.  If you are a fan of less sweet dark-style chocolates, than transitioning to this sugar free band is easy.<br /><br />If I didn't know any better I would give this product 3 or 4 stars because it is not as good as regular chocolate.  But having tried to make my own for years, I recognize when I've been outdone and I'm giving it a 5 star review.  I've also tried many brands of sugar free chocolate over the years, and I like this one the best.<br /><br />On the downside, I think this chocolate is too pricey.  When I ordered mine, it was shipped in an insulated container with cold packs to keep it stable.  This was in the spring and early fall - perhaps in the winter they forgo this treatment.  (They don't ship at all in the heat of summer.)  So perhaps the extra cost is to cover the special shipping."

I don't use caffiene and real coffee has a wickedly bitter after taste.  Stevia has completely replaced sugar in my kitchen.  I use it in everything from cereal to baking.  This is a good price.  I like the Sweet Leaf cream soda, but it is expensive. Their toffee flavor is too strong.<br /><br />I am surprised by the number of reviewers who use artificial sweetners, such as the exotoxic aspartame- NutraSweet (the most poisonous), Sweet N Low (at least the body recognizes it as a chemical so it doesn't pass through the blood brain barrier), Splendia, Sucralose, etc. Now there is a new toxin spewing from the malevolent (yes, what would you call a company who has developed anti-nature terminator seeds?!) Monsanto called Neotame, which is unbelievably being labeled as ""organic"". Stevia is actually good for you. I try to avoid any product, especially food, that is made in China, although it is nearly impossible to do these days, particularily if you shop at Wal-mart (the great Wal of China).

These raise the blood sugar which spikes the insulin, a hormone whose message is ""store fat!"" Insulin also causes the kidneys to retain water and therefore I would bloat from a high carb diet.<br /><br />My dilemma is that I love sweets--and now it is not a problem, thanks to products like stevia, a natural plant that has safely been used in parts of the world as a sweetener for hundreds of years. It has no calories and no impact on the blood sugar (although for some people there might be a bit, as the brain is tricked into thinking it is getting sugar). Stevia used to be legal in the USA only as a cosmetic product because of politics: companies that made low calorie sweeteners such as aspartame did not want competition. Yet, aspartame gave me headaches and even sometimes symptoms of multiple sclerosis. So I would use stevia at times, but the aftertaste was bad--and to be honest, I wasn't too crazy about the ""during taste"" either.<br /><br />Then I tried NuNaturals. This product is awesome and like no other stevia I have tried. It is not only delicious but also has no aftertaste (unless you put in way too much--a common mistake by people new to this). It comes in tablets and in powdered form (in a bottle or handy packets with individual servings). It also comes in alcohol-free liquid form and even in vanilla flavor. Unlike aspartame (which becomes even more toxic when heated) stevia can be used in baking. NuNaturals has a stevia baking blend just for that. (Since I am a raw fooder, I can't tell you how it tastes, but I am sure it is good, judging by their other products.)<br /><br />Thanks to these great products, I can do a low carb raw diet but not be deprived of my sweets!"

40749,B000LKYYBU,A1DSI0B2N07GKI,"Arius Cayne ""Arius Cayne""",1,1,5,1314921600,"Hot Damn, This Is GREAT!","I pondered buying this product for days because of mixed reviews, many concerning the size of the ginger. I feel for those people who got scraps, but in my 24-pack I received pretty uniform cubes of a VERY good size. This is, hands down, the best crystallized ginger I've ever had except for once... and that was home-made in Hong Kong.<br /><br />First, the chunks are just the right size to be tender and sweet without being too large to enjoy as a snack. The quality of the ginger is outstanding, with a deep, fresh flavor and just the right amount of sugar. The color is a light gold, and the texture lacks the fibrous strands of mature ginger that too much crystallized ginger is made from. So, they say baby ginger, and I can attest, it must be. Because of that, the flavor is strong without being an overpowering heat, but the heat is there. I'd place it on the mild end of the ginger spectrum, which works for me, but if you want fire this isn't for you. This is one of two crystallized gingers I'd recommend, and the other is the fiery one (Reed's), but this has the better overall flavor of ginger.<br /><br />This is definitely ginger for snacking; if you want to bake with this you could, but you'd definitely need to get busy with the knife-work. If you're looking for dried ginger, this isn't that either... this is fresh, tender, and sweet-heat ginger. For tea... I could see mashing a cube or two and making something pretty terrific, but I'd probably end up eating it straight. I'm gong to buy some of the baking cut (small nuggets) for ginger snaps now, because if they're using the same ginger it's going to be amazing.<br /><br />Bottom line: while it's possible that some people received a bad package with small pieces, in 24 packs I saw minimal variation in size, and nothing I'd describe as too large or small. This is fresh as hell, not too sugared, and the quality of the ginger is out of this world. If you like ginger, I'd find it hard to imagine not falling in love with this."

This is on top of the fact that they were double the size of what I normally view a chocolate covered raisin. Truth be told, when I first looked at the bag, I thought I had received chocolate covered peanuts or something. The label readily allayed that fear.<br />Nonetheless, I was still skeptical and had thoughts of giant raisins inside a thick coating of chocolate. Well, the raisins seem to of normal stature after comparing one sans chocolate. But the chocolate coating was definitely thick. Therefore, if you like chocolate with a little raisin mixed in, you'll love this Koppers product (that's me). If you would prefer a little chocolate with your raisin, maybe the Sunmaid brand would be more suitable.<br />I purchased the Sunmaid product and liked it as well. Packaging is a little nicer compared to Koppers' plastic bag. However, it does make a lot of noise during shipping.

The recipe says it makes 10 pancakes with 1 cup of the mix. Those 10 pancakes must be silver dollar size.  I am looking forward to making the biscuits so I will have to open a second box to have enough mix. The recipe calls for eggs for biscuits and I never used eggs in my regular biscuits.  I am wondering if buttermilk would make these biscuits rise sufficiently? I have family members who can't eat eggs or milk so I must adapt recipes for them. It is a product I would purchase again.

Well, I got my order, and even sent a an order to my mother. The so-called smell was pretty mild. Once the noodles were thoroughly rinsed in a colander (preferably in hot water) they were just fine and ready to cook. Now, if you try making spaghetti, or any Italian dish, these noodles will fail you. They are not Italian pasta. They are made for soups, stir fries, and basically Asian cooking. In case the name didn't give it away - let me advise you that these noodles originated in Japan. I stir-fried these noodles with my own mix of vegetables  in minutes. They were awesome! This is the absolute best way to have them. Since April I've lost close to 50lbs by moving to a more vegetarian diet, and these noodles have made my meal planning even easier. I would strongly recommend them - but for people interested in making Asian pasta dishes (Lo Mein, Stir-fry, soups, etc)."

I also plan to try the Special Blend variety of PG Tips to see what that is like.

If you've been drinking the usual American grocery store teas (Lipton, Bigelow, etc.), you will notice a big difference.  At least I did.

This is a healthy, organic treat that we don't have to feel guilty about feeding (in moderation) to our three year old pointer.<br /><br />My wife and I try to provide good nutrition for our dog. Corn, wheat, and soy are basically useless filler when it comes to dogs. They can't digest it, and furthermore many dogs are allergic to wheat. These Newman's Own Ranch Style treats do not contain any of those ingredients. They also do not contain any artificial additives, not for flavoring or coloring.<br /><br />Also important: these treats are NOT a product of China. I would sooner prepare all my dog's food from scratch than feed her any dog food/treats produced in China. These treats are a product of New Zealand.<br /><br />Grains are not an essential part of a dog's diet, but the one grain included in these treats - organic barley - is (from what I understand) generally an acceptable one.

Used them almost daily until I couldn't afford them anymore... went to the ""Rock On"" shot from Walgreens because they were much cheaper and I could the 6-packs 2-for-1... Been using them for over a year and I just saw these so I bought a bunch... at $1 a piece, they are the cheapest and were basically the same as the rest...  They work just as well as the rest.<br /><br />Ingredients are all similar, some minor differences:  this has an ""enzyme blend""...  this also has slightly more of the ""energy blend"" than others (the energy blend is a combination of Taurine, Malic Acid, Caffeine, among other things).  It has 0 calories, some other products do have a few calories.  This also has a bit of Niacin which can give some a slight tingly feeling in their skin for a few minutes... I've taken Niacin before and gotten that tingly feeling, but don't get that with this drink.  This also has a small bit of Sodium.<br /><br />The taste is the same as all the other energy drinks.  They all have a slight aftertaste.  I actually like Grape and Berry the best.  The Orange has always been my worst flavor in all the drinks.  Again, they are all similar.  There is no real difference in taste or in aftertaste.<br /><br />The effect of all these drinks is profound.  Not in a bad way, they make me much more productive at work.  I sit behind a desk most of the day and 1 of these in the morning keeps me alert and more focused throughout the day.  When not at work, I will usually be very lazy around the house, but take one of these, and I'm cleaning the attic in a few minutes, and planning my next activity while doing that!

I have tried various brands and like the Navitas Naturals brand the best of the 4 or 5 brands I have tried.  Not sure if the ""organic"" promises they provide are absolutely true, but as a consumer of several Navitas Naturals products I certainly hope so.  In any event, it beats buying some of the bulk chia seeds I have found at local stores with little or no explanation of where the seeds really come from.<br /><br />In all, I find chia seeds rather tasteless.  The joy in eating them, if there is any, is in the texture / crunch they provide.  Some other brands had what I assume was foreign matter, which made the texture uneven or, worse, hard like having little rocks in the mix.<br /><br />My motivation for adding them to my diet was to increase my Omega 3 intake from plant sources and add more fiber as well.  I have noticed improvement in my overall health since eating them, but I can't say for sure if chia played any role in that because I changed my diet in many other ways and greatly increased my work out schedule.  Just to be safe, I'm going to continue eating chia every morning and adding it as often as possible for other meals throughout the day.<br /><br />As a very happy customer, I plan on continuing my subscription to Navitas Naturals Chia Seeds for a long time."

They come running from any room in the house when they hear the bag open.  They LOVE Bravo's real meat treats!"

10978,B001BIXK7K,A2CCRV4PAOSYQJ,Christopher Stayner,0,0,5,1328659200,Da Bomb: The Final Answer?  Yes.,"This sauce is most definitely hot.  Not intolerable, but definitely hot, the hottest I own and I have sauces made from the Ghost Pepper. I put a drop about the diameter of a pea on a tortilla chip.  Immediately you have the flavor, which isn't too bad to be honest.  Kind of a dark, smoky, pepper fruit flavor.  Then the heat shows up and keeps building from a tinge until your mouth feels like its glowing.  Maybe its because I wasn't an idiot who took a spoonful of the stuff, but there was no 30 minute burn.  The real burn lasted 5, *maybe* 10 minutes.  The gut bomb that everyone talks about?  Nonexistent.  And I am not one of these people who claim to eat habaneros plain on their own, because I don't.  Personally I have to call BS on the people that say that.  Its a bit expensive for a 2 oz bottle, but when all it takes to give something a pleasant heat is a drop or two without changing flavor, its worth the price.  This sauce will last you for a while.<br /><br />Final thought:  Dont be a hero and try to take a whole spoonful of this.  Not only is it too expensive to use it like that, but take that much and you will regret it."

There are peas and carrots in it and the  consistency of it is very mushy. She likes it that way, so she doesn't have to chew much.

For those that are familiar with this spice, nough said, and for those that are not I can only ask you to try it in your gourmet cooking. You will find many different reviews on it on the net, some filed with blessings and some filled with warnings. This plant compatibility is very specific, so to evaluate you need to try and decide for yourself. Nobody said that Eskimos and Somali will be happy on the same diet. To explain details: do you remember those small cubes of ""whatever"" with names like ""instant chicken soup"" or something like that? Well, those are now, by our modern standards made of things that you would be reluctant today to give to your dog. The funny thing is, they are still in production and people eat it. Here now is the real thing that started it all, natural, no nonsense, used by generations in many places like Argentina, China, India and few other countries for hundreds of years. It is called Fenugreek. Buy it, add one tea spoon to a quart of your soup before boiling, and find out how it makes your meal wholesome, healthy, custom and aromatic. If you prefer macaroni and cheese flushed with aspartame and saccharine US food this is most likely not for you and you should stick to your plastic burgers, but if you are searching for wholesome and specific flavors combines with medicinal values, this product will be just what you need in your kitchen. When I got it opened in my house, the ""oh my God..."" was what I have heard from wife and kids. Then I purchased 5 more bags and vacuum packed it. You get an idea.

They LOVE it and will do just about anything for it, so it is a great treat to use for training. (Powdered freeze dried liver is even added to many dog medicines nowadays-- heartworm and arthritis tablets, etc.-- because it causes the dog to scarf the medicine down like a treat.)<br /><br />Freeze dried liver has a dry, hard, yet powdery/easy to chew consistency. It comes chopped/cubed. It is extremely lightweight due to the fact there is so little moisture in the product (thus the low weights on product labels).<br /><br />Even though your dog will love liver treats, you shouldn't overfeed it. The manufacturer recommends 1-2 cubes daily for small dogs, 2-3 cubes for medium dogs, and 3-4 cubes for large dogs.<br /><br />The largest package sizes of liver treats tend to be far more economical. I recommend buying the larger tubs, as you will save lots of money, you'll have a handy treat supply around for a longer time, and your dog will never tire of this product.<br /><br />There is really zero waste with this product. When you near the end of the tub you'll find some powdery bits of dried liver at the bottom. Your dogs will go CRAZY if you sprinkle this dust over their dog food-- it's a wonderful reward that is easy to use.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />Here's the nutritional analysis:<br /><br />-100% freeze dried liver<br />-NO additives or preservatives.<br /><br />-Crude protein..... not less than 50%<br />-Crude fat..... not less than 5%<br />-Crude fiber..... not more than 3%<br />-Moisture..... not more than 6%"

But, I do enjoy a good strong cup of coffee. The Emerils bold is exactly what I was looking for. I know there are always those out there that say, ""nowhere close to my custom grind and French press."" But, I use the keurig for the convenience and variety. The emerils bold is perfect for what I want - a good strong cup of coffee to start off my work day.<br />***********<br />Update 7/26/12<br />I've tried a couple other ""bold"" coffee's, just to compare. (Brooklyn Beanery Fugettaboutit and Jet Fuel)  Not all bolds are the same. The other bolds seemed more bitter. (Some people think that bitter = strong coffee. Not true, strong coffee = good coffee, bitter coffee = bad coffee.) I'm done experimenting with different brands. For a good, strong cup of coffee, Emeril's Big Easy Bold will be my go to coffee from now on.<br /><br />Also, I just want to make one more comment on defective K-Cups. I see alot of reviews for both Emeril's and other K-Cups saying saying that they are horrible because 1 in every 3 explode in their Keurig machine. My wife and I go through 60 - 70 K-Cups per month, since December 2011. We've never had a problem with any of them. (when I say 60 - 70, they're not all Emeril's bold - we would be bouncing off the walls. We also use Caribou breakfast blend, decaf, green tea, heral tea, and hot cocoa.)"

It is not at all bitter.  Avocado oil is pressed from the flesh of the avocado, not the seed.<br /><br />It is especially good drizzled on fresh-baked bread or pizza.  It is nice on a salad although if there are other strong flavors for it to compete with such as balsamic vinegar, onions, or cheese, consider using a less expensive oil with a more competitive flavor such as first-press olive oil and save this for when you can better appreciate its unique sensory qualities.  There is a recipe on the label for a citrus dressing with equal parts of this oil and citrus juice with a little honey, salt, and pepper which complements the flavor of the oil rather than overpowers it as a dressing with vinegar does.<br /><br />Avocado oil also has a medium-high smoke point, higher than that of olive oil, so it is safer to use for cooking on the stove top although there are less expensive oils just as suitable for this purpose.<br /><br />Avocado oil is also an excellent oil for use on the skin and the scent is pleasant enough that I will dab a little on my elbows and knuckles when using it in the kitchen.<br /><br />The oil is packaged in a can to protect it from light and the lid fits tightly, although I have found that it will drip from the spout and collect on top of the can.  Twisting the can at the end of the pour (as with a bottle of wine) helps prevent this.  It can be stored at a reasonable room temperature but it would be better off in the refrigerator in warm climates or instead of over the oven.<br /><br />I purchased my La Tourangelle Avocado Oil at a organic grocery store chain (known for high prices) because other customers have reported that they have received rancid cans from Amazon, probably from sitting in a hot warehouse.

Clean cup, fill 2/3rds filtered water. 90 seconds in the microwave.  Shake contents to bottom of pack.  Rip the whole top off the pack with teeth.  Pour pack in coup and watch sizzle.

Woodrow,2,2,5,1256515200,Excellent Busy-Buddy Tool,"This is one of the greatest inventions for Dogs that either eat too fast or need to be preoccupied with something to do. We have been using the jug about 8 months and have stopped feeding our dog with the dog dish and now only use the Jug. It takes him several minutes to get his food out, keeps him entertained and he actually chews his kibble instead of inhaling everything in 10 seconds like he would do out of the dish. The jug can also be filled with treats and is a great tool for dogs with attachment issues. For example, our dog used to go nuts and tear up the house when we left, but now we fill the jug with kibble before we leave to keep him busy. It keeps his mind occupied long enough to forget about us leaving and as a result he no longer becomes destructive when we are away. If you have a dog that is too smart for his/her own good and needs a good toy to keep 'em busy then I would recommend the Jug hands down. I have gone through more dog toys in the last 18-months than I care to admit and this has been the most effective, long-lasting items that is actually worth more than what you will pay. Your dog will thank you too!"

My mother, all her sisters, my grandmother, and all our friends considered Lipton Loose Tea to be TEA. There was no other for them.  I grew up thinking anything else was an ""off"" brand.  (Lipton Tea is America's favorite tea.)<br /><br />In the South most people make it sweet.  They add the sugar while it is hot so less sugar is required.  Now I prefer to use Splenda (SPLENDA No Calorie Sweetener Granular, 9.7-Ounce Resealable Bags (Pack of 2)) and lemon juice. This tea has a strong black-tea taste.  It is robust and pure.<br /><br />When I moved across the Mississippi River, I was shocked to discover that people in Louisiana drink their tea three times as strong as they do in Mississippi. I think one reason my people liked Lipton Loose Tea so much was that we had very little money and we had to make things go as far as possible.  It was always a good bargain.  Almost any kind of tea is an excellent bargain.<br /><br />Nutritonally it is outstanding.  It is a means of hydrating, which is considered important.  (Always hydrate responsibly:  don't drink too much! You would not want to drown.) Also it is an excellent source of flavonoids, which provide antioxidants. A glass of tea has about half as much caffeine as a cup of coffee.  Since the ingredients vary with different practices, it is difficult to estimate the amount of caffeine.<br />Some caffeine can help many people.<br /><br />On my blog, which you can find at Flavored with Love: Mary Lou's Family and Friends Can Cook, I talked about my mother's tea and all the spread she used to make when she took food to church for dinner on the grounds.  The name of the blog entry is ""Myrtle's Stuffed Eggs.""<br /><br />About stains -- it is helpful to brush and polish your teeth immediately after enjoying this wonderful tea.  Also, you can clean glasses, pitchers, etc., with baking soda. One more tip is to drink with a straw to try to avoid getting so much of the liquid on your front teeth. (I do this, but I don't think it helps much.)<br /><br />I hope you found this review helpful."

The vet recommended switching to a grain free product, and Natural Balance made a HUGE difference. Lucy is ""regular"" again for the first time in probably three years after many failed prescriptions from another vet. All three cats are puking much much less! Let's face it, sometimes they just do it for sport, but we can go a week without somekitty hurling, and that's major! The food may have higher calorie content- only one of the cats needed to gain weight, but all three have! That can easily be adjusted in portions served, however. I highly recommend this project. All cats are happier, more energetic, healthier, and have less behaviors. It would be awesome if I could put it on auto ship like you can with some other products, because sometimes I don't order it in time. It is a little pricey, but it's worth it to have less messes to clean up and healthier cats. P.S. We've tried all flavors, with similar results, although chicken seems to be their favorite."

866,B000VKYKTG,A1WX42M589VAMQ,Mir,1,1,5,1278288000,"Fun ""popping-crispy"" sticks dipped in chocolate, special treat for manga fans, but find local or wait till fall","Pocky is just plain fun to eat. I discovered these snacks at an anime convention (though I'd heard about them before and had seen manga characters eating them). They are very, very slim sticks of biscuity stuff (the flavor to me is a cross between waffle cones and pretzels) that have a charming tiny popping crispness. The chocolate flavor, a nice non-bitter, non-dark, generically pleasing choco-taste, seems to be the most popular (given how fast they sell out at cons), but I prefer the flavor of the strawberry which is like strawberry ice cream. Very nice.<br /><br />This is by no means a health food (it's in the same category as a cookie, it's got fat and sugar and non-healthful ingredients). But hey, it's junk food. We all know it's supposed to be OCCASIONAL and not habitual in the diet. Unless you're really prone to binge-eating or can't stop yourself a whole one of these smaller boxes is not a huge calorie splurge if you stick to a reasonable number. 10 of the chocolate pocky sticks will set you back 125 calories with 5 grams of fat, 3 of them saturated. I wouldn't recommend just scarfing down multiple boxes. In fact, just nibble these slowly and have fun with the cool texture effect.<br /><br />If you love the flavor of coconut-chocolate together (like Almond Joy) try the coconut chocolate ones. They're really so good, oh man. Hubby says the taste reminds him of the Girl Scout 'caramel delights"" cookies which are, in turn, similar to the old Yes Yes cookies (from the seventies or so).<br /><br />Anyway, if you have read manga or seen anime with young folks eating those stick-looking treats, or seen footage of cute Japanese girls nibbling at skinny little stick treats, this is what they were eating. :) Fun treats.<br /><br />However, with this crazy hot summer, I'd recommend you look for a local retailer or wait until fall's cooler weather. You might get a sticky, clumped mess of Pocky sticks in this deep summer weather. (Look for local stores that specialize in Japanese anime or manga and they'll likely carry Japanese snacks like these. In South Florida, Tate's Comics has them in a variety of flavors..and FRESH and NOT MELTED)."

I usually chew 2 pieces at a time, so they are a bit small and #2 they just changed the packaging. It used to fit nicely in your back pant pocket, inside suit jacket pocket etc, now its twice as thick and poorly layed out so it's bulky.

His stools would vary from constipated to unformed soft stool. I decided to switch him to a better quality food and did a lot of research. Newman's Own had all the qualities I was looking for, so I switched him to it gradually - 1/2 Purina One and 1/2 Newman's Own at first and gradually more Newmans' Own in the mix until finally 100% N.O. Ever since switching about six weeks ago, he has not had constipation or loose stools. I also don't hear his tummy roiling after meals like before. And despite what a few reviewers have written, the chicken and beef used in the pet food, while not ""organic"", is ""natural"" and raised without hormones and antibiotics.<br /><br />According to [...] ingredients list: ""Natural Chicken - Raised without growth hormones and antibiotics and fed only a 100% natural, all-vegetable diet, the chicken meat provides amino acids essential for muscles, hormones, enzymes, antibodies and structural and protective tissues.""

The ""nuts"" on top don't seem like nuts at all to me, but in a good way. The rest of the bar is very moist and soft, so the nuts add a nice contrast of crisp and crunchy texture.

The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS).

At least 40 different nations have as well as organizations have published standards similar to the RDA.<br /><br />Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the body and is essential to good health. Approximately 50% of total body magnesium is found in bone. The other half is found predominantly inside cells of body tissues and organs. Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br />Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women. Magnesium is extremely safe by mouth - too much simply causes diarrhea.

He eats the venison & potato dry food and gets a low maintenance dose of prednisone.  The IVD (now Royal Canin) food worked well, but we've were outraged by the constant price hikes and annoyed by the inconvenience of only be able to buy the food at a vet.  Then we discovered Natural Balance.  On a price per pound basis it's about half the price. Our dog has done very well with this food.  Although there is no way for me to be sure, I also think it's likely that sweet potato is more nutritious than plain potato, so that's another benefit.  If you buy from Amazon there is free shipping and no sales tax, as well.<br />The food is a little more dense, so if you're switching from Royal Canin you might want to weigh your regular feeding of the old food, and determine how much of a scoop of the new food gives the same weight.  Not a big difference, but if you want to feed the exact same amount then go by weight.<br />Very pleased with this food.

Zero carbs, fat, calories..... Is this truly a miracle food? The pasta arrived super fast but I was nervous to try them. Today was the day. I got the stainer ready and quickly opened one package and dumped the angel hair pasta in and started to rinse. I read about the fish smell and didn't want that to spoil my experience. I have to say that the smell was not real noticeable especially with the quick dump and rinse method. And not there at all after some cold water rinsing.<br /><br />My recipe was quick and easy. Take a handful of shrimp (i used frozen cooked shrimp that I had already) saut&eacute; in a little EVOO with garlic and onion powder. Add a few tablespoons of salsa and a few green olives. Add the angle hair pasta and heat through. I took half of a low carb Italian herd tortilla and cut it into wedges and toasted in the toaster oven till crisp. (This gave me the crunch that is usually missing from a low carb diet but only 3 net carbs.)  The pasta really did take on the flavor of the sauce and lost some of the rubbery texture.<br /><br />The Miracle Noodles are not a flour noodle so you can not expect them to taste the exact same but they are a great no carb option. I am very pleased with my purchase and I would buy them again."

The taste is fairly forgettable but not regrettable. If you need a pure bulk, as fast as you can, I recommend cyto-gainer but we all know whey is tough on the stomach of many people, including myself.<br /><br />There's been a lot of controversy regarding the high protein for muscle gain/weight loss and the jury seems to still be out. However, what I can say for sure (because Doctors and nutritionists have told me) is that more than 1g of protein per body weight is going to cause health issues over the long term. Also, the ideal ratio for carbos/fat/protein varies by body type and desired goal, the best way to learn is through trial and error. Personally, a diet relatively high in fat and protein works well for me, but that's only ideal for the short term.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this product for either people who can't take whey or for those wanting to get lean. Pure egg is a purely brilliant idea..."

I serve 2 quarters to one cat and the other 2 to the other. They gulp them down. And the ingriedient list is spectacular. So good I have been tempted to try them. The highest weight ingridients are chicken, turkey, turkey live, turked heart, pumpkinseeds....Then a bunch of other mostly vegetables. Crude protien is minimum of 40%.<br /><br />I feel great about giving these treats to my cats. By far the healtiest treats we have ever given them. They also come in a nice package with a resealable inner plastic bag. I would highly recommend these for cats and small dogs.

I am a dealer and own and operate a pet boarding facility.  I switch dogs everyday to Canidae without mixing diets due to the nature of the business and it saves me tons in labor.  The dogs not only gobble it up - they do not get upset tummies.  I have been feeding my pack of competitive working dogs (Border Collies and Australian Shepherds) for 6 years and about 30 boarding dogs per day and I have not found anything even close to the quality and value of Canidae.  Many kennels try to cut corners on feed but I believe paying a little more for Canidae has made money.  The dogs feel great, the kennels stay clean, and the owners have peace of mind. (Less poop to scoop is a big deal around here) I am a strong supporter of any feed company that puts together an all natural - excellent ingredient product and have tried many, but I'm completely sold on Canidae."

I have the single mesh filter plastic re usable one, but the ""convenience"" factor of a disposable is not there. you have to then clean it and all that mess. with this product, simply pop a filter (included_ into the cup, (included) fill it with 1-2tsp of your own blend, or folgers starbucks, anything. and use the included cup holder to pop a lid on (which are also included) I bought 50 and am now so happy with these I'm ordering 200 more. why?? because for the 12-15$ you spend on these cups you can make 50 coffee's  if you have some regular coffee in your fridge, use that. you can even say a bag of starbucks breakfast blend ground is around 10.00, so your at 22.00 , thats only 2 boxes of 12 Kcups coffee's and you can fill 75-100 on a single 1lb bag, a 1.5lb tub of folgers can fill about 400 of these refills for 9.00 for the tub  so go for it, you won't regret it...<br /><br />one thing i want to point out is the included filters DO hang out the edges a bit, nothing wrong, it just adds to the seal, and depending on your brewers strength you can see ""seepage"" AFTER brewing a cup, but who cares, they are disposable. if you are a total cheap wad you can pop the lids off and use the cups again if you don't mind a whole in the bottom from where the brewer pops it. but your Freshness won't last with a re used cup.

Given that caveat I think this is an amazing product!  I actually have 2 (one for each dog) and it is their favorite way to get a meal.  It keeps them occupied for about 10-15 minutes but you can tell they are thinking and having a blast and they are generally ready to settle down and relax for a bit afterwards.  I have one with a real rope and one with a rubber rope.  Each has benefits and downsides.  I would recommend getting the large even for little dogs, my sister had a 4lb yorkie and he has no problem operating the medium/large size toy.  My dogs are a 25lb cocker and a 35lb mix so I cannot comment on the appropriateness of this toy for large dogs.  If the toy is too difficult you can take the rope out until they get the hang of it.  Also my cocker will sometimes unscrew the back instead of working each piece out through the top but that actually takes him longer so I don't mind."

I've always snubbed Pill Pockets because of the expense - it was cheaper to bury medicines in pieces of hot dog, cheese, or bread or even burying it in peanut butter.  Stubborn Spike managed to figure all of these out though due to the strong scent of the medicine, and it made medicating him a nightmare.  As a last resort, I ordered Pill Pockets to give them a whirl.<br /><br />These really do make giving Spike his medicine so much easier!  In a week, he never turned his nose up or spit out medicine, and that means a lot less stress for this puppy mom.  Another reviewer said this and I figured I'd reiterate - they're a lot like chicken (or other meat, depending on your flavor) putty that's pre-shaped for capsules.  Spike's capsules (at 500mg each) were a little big for these pockets, but it was easy to shape around.  I know I'll be using these again rather than any other methods I've tried before."

Namely that it appears healthier for you and your children. This is that goat milk in the human study does not produce bovine caso-morphin-7 (BCM-7). This  peptide is produced by digestion of all of the cow milk available in the US. It is not produced by goat milk (or human milk).<br /><br /> There are a number of conditions for which bovine casomorphin-7  seems to play a role, including atherosclerosis (and hence heart disease and strokes), Type 1 diabetes, schizophrenia, autism, milk intolerance (not due to lactose intolerance) and sudden infant death syndrome.<br /><br /> The source for the above information is Woodford's recent book <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1603581022"">Devil in the Milk: Illness, Health and the Politics of A1 and A2 Milk</a>.  Amazon lets you read significant fractions by searching with the keywords for what interests you, although I suggest buying the book and reading the full evidence.<br /><br /> While the milk of not all cows produce BCM-7 when digested, in the US milk free from these problems can not be bought(such milk can be bought in New Zealand and Australia). Thus, for those that wish to protect themselves and their children, the alternatives are to avoid cow milk (substituting something else, such as breast milk for babies), or use goat milk. Fortunately, calcium or other nutrients in milk can be obtained from foods other than milk. If we wish to consume milk, goat milk is the most available alternative for most outside of New Zealand and Australia.<br /><br /> However, goat milk is available in only a few stores, and these may not be near you. In these cases, a powdered goat milk, or a canned goat milk may be the healthy alternative. Powdered is cheaper than canned. If you do not anticipate using large amounts, having it in these 4 ounce packages will reduce the risk of the powder going bad before being used."

I was recently given a small sampler pack that had two of each of their coffee's in it. I usually don't drink coffee on a regular basis as most brands make me feel like I dropped an acid bomb in my tummy (Starbucks is like an acid neutron bomb to the gut). Ganocafe Classic is pretty good stuff especially if you like your coffee black. Low acidity and a great taste and it doesn't give you the jitters like a lot of those energy drinks on the market. I know some of you that rely on western culture might think the red mushroom and it's healing properties is a gimmick but I believe it really works. My dad swears by this stuff and it even helped him take positive steps to get over the bottle and some of the long term effects that my pops was suffering from due to overuse of the bottle. Now I'm not saying this is the be all and end all cure to everything including cancer and aids but I will say that this stuff does work. I feel like I got more pep in my step and can't recall feeling that crashing feeling from it. I will be ordering a box or two of the classic for the office. As a matter fact all the flavors I have tried so far are pretty darn good (Ganocafe Mocha, 3-in-1 and the classic)."

It became too disgusting for words. It was the only time in my tween years that I wrote to a company to complain. Y&S Candies sent me back a letter saying that molasses had become too expensive and was no longer being used in the licorice, but they included coupons for spaghetti sauce as an appeasement. Inexplicable. In any case, my licorice consumption declined. A few years later, I developed a horrid gluten intolerance, and my licorice days were over for good.<br /><br />Or so I thought.<br /><br />After nearly 20 years without licorice (OK! I admit I would steal an occasional nibble...), I was shocked, SHOCKED to find Candy Tree Gluten-free licorice, and best of all, it's pretty darn tasty! I blame Candy Tree for restarting my sugar addiction, but I just can't stop eating it. I highly recommend this product. I like the licorice twists the best, but the ropes are good, too.

Sometimes I threw out more than 5, most times 2 or 3, but I honestly cannot remember the last time I used every single one.  That is, until now.  Inside the savor pod, they grow and keep for weeks (easily more than 3).  I am planning on buying the set of mini savor pods so I can actually use them for fresh herbs - storing my herbs in the same container as my onions is not a good idea.  The only drawback with this product is that the clear plastic cover is a little tricky to remove as others have mentioned, but wrestling with it is OK with me so long as I can use all my product before it goes bad."

I feed my 11 year old German Shepard, and my two year old Pittie Girl this food every day, and the benefits are astounding.  For most of my Shepards life I fed her a well known, vet recommended food, and yet she always had stomach problems.  Trying many things, it was not until I rescued, and I should really say she rescued me, and the dog food recall, that I began doing research on brands of food.  After a long investigation, I decided on Newman's Own, not only because there had been no recall on the food, but because of the ingredients, and that the proceeds going to charity. Now, choosing this brand, would mean that I would have to order it online, because my local stores did not carry it, but that was all right with me, because not only do I enjoy online ordering, but I am an older, disabled woman, and getting to the store and hauling in packages is very hard for me.  Well, I want to tell you, My 11 year old thrives on this food, with no more digestive issues, and a beautiful white coat, and she loves eating it with vigor. My two year old American Pit Bull Terrier, another love of my life, also thrives on this food, has the most beautiful shiny coat ever, and people say all the time how beautiful her coat is.  I do spoil my fur kids, but their health and well being is my number one priority.  I have just recently switched over feeding my 4 cats Newman's Own cat food, both dry and canned food, and since then, I have noticed the difference in the elimination of hair balls.  I know that I am truly a pet lover, but I believe that if you love your pets and want only the best well being for them, unnecessary medical issues, and all around good health, a good balanced, safe, natural food is the way to go.  I highly recommend Newman's Own dog and cat food.  I also feed my two dogs Newman's Own biscuits as treats."

Some dogs attempt to swallow pieces that are too large, and so they gag. As a dog owner, you MUST monitor your dog while it's chewing.

I love that these chips are low in calorie/fat but taste 10X better than baked chips. There's something about a need for salt n crunch that baked chips don't solve for me. I've found most of them to be bland, flat, weird, cracker-like. As soon as you put one of these chips in your mouth you'll realize that they're not lightweights at all. I love the salt/vinegar and was very surprised that they don't lack flavor or taste less salty/vinegar(y) than their high calorie counterparts.

To be honest, I don't know how they do it but I'm delighted they do.  We buy this tea by the case.<br /><br />The flavor of this tea is crisp and clear, rich, but never bitter.  I had been accustomed to have my tea English-style with cream, but Newman's Own black tea is so flavorful and mellow I've taken to having it straight up all the time.

After two years of glucosamine supplements, she is tearing around the yard after our two younger dogs again.  It used to be a struggle to feed her the giant pills, and to remember them every day.  Now we just give the two younger dogs their Greenies and she gets her special one all at once as a daily treat--she views it as a reward, and it's easy for us to be consistent.  They are also labeled by week-day so that my partner and I no longer become confused about whether one of us has already medicated the dog on any given day.<br /><br />She has been on these for half a year now, and if anything, she has improved from her time on the pill supplements.  About a month ago she jumped onto our bed, which is about 3 feet off the ground.  We were delighted; for a long time she could barely stand up.  If your older dog has limited mobility due to joint problems, definitely give these a chance!"

That's what I thought when my vet suggested the idea about our orange tiger, who was suffering from a persistent redness to his stomach and gums.  But after experimenting with different types of food to pinpoint the allergen, fish looked like the culprit.  Thus the search for fish-free dry food, which was a LOT more difficult than I'd imagined.  Many (most?) of the grain-free varieties, even those labeled ""beef,"" ""chicken,"" ""turkey,"" etc., still contained fish meal or fish oil, so you usually need a ""Limited Ingredients Diet"" food.  I like Natural Balance because (1) the cats like it (good reason); (2) they have at least two flavors, green pea/chicken, and green pea/duck; and (3) for a ""premium"" brand, it's still reasonably priced.  FYI, for those who have fish-allergic cats, for dry food I've found Natural Balance, Holistic (duck), Basics by Blue Buffalo, and Instinct (turkey) -- out of those, our cats have liked the NB the best.  Love to hear if anyone has any other fish-free dry food recommendations."

When I visited Pure Foods website, I was very pleased that they had several kinds of ghee including the regular.  For example, they have digestive ghee..which includes spices (helpful for digestion) some of which are also traditionally used to make chai tea. I love this digestive ghee because I can make regular black tea and add the digestive ghee & a little sweetner and it makes a nice chai tea.  It warms me up during the cold and dampness and another added benefit..my stools come out much smoother..and constipation is usually eiliminated completely when I use it consistently.

There's no added sugar, no corn syrup, and no preservatives. It's carbonated but is all natural and is 100% juice.

The kiwi berry flavor is pretty sweet (as kiwis and strawberries are), so I would probably recommend drinking this with a pastry or something like that. A fruity danish would be perfect. Pairing sweet to sweet is key.<br /><br />I'm really pleased with this flavor, so I will surely look into the other flavors available, most likely the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LGGH54"">watermelon strawberry</a> since I'll probably get a similar taste.

Turns out the hip was fine but the ball on her leg bone was broken sometime when she was a puppy. It caused her immense pain when moved in certain positions and caused her to limp. Running fast was out of the question and jumping was only for the lowest of heights. Even when she sat her left leg would be out to the side at an awkward angle. She was stuck in a catch 22. She couldn't make it stronger because it hurt and it hurt because it was so weak.<br /><br />We tried glucosamine supplements, but they were powdery and she seemed to not like the taste. The chicken jerky with glucosamine all seemed to be from china with an FDA advisory for liver and kidney problems.<br /><br />That's when I found Zukes hip action. The first time I opened the package the dog danced on her hind legs just to get a better sniff. The squares are soft and dense. They split into smaller pieces easily for training or to extend the reward time. The dog is sure to find even the smallest crumb. These treats last a long time with a small/medium sized dog like mine.  The bag makes a satisfying crinkle sound the dogs listens for. I really like that they are high quality and made in America.<br /><br />The improvement began immediately and after a few weeks of daily treats the difference was in the use of her hind leg was amazing. More cushion and flex in her hip let her use her leg more. Now she is much more active with better behavior and lots more running and jumping. She even sits down with both legs under her. Another thing I noticed was when she would lay in her bed on her back her bad leg would be pulled in. Now both legs spread out like normal for easier tummy rubs. When she is being silly she even army crawls. I only wish we had found them sooner. If you saw this dog running around you would never know she had a hip problem in the past."

Now, my dog is not very picky, but he definitely reacts with more enthusiasm in training according to how much he likes the treat being used. And boy, does he LOVE these!

One ounce contain approximately 20% of the RDA for an adult recommended dietary allowance (RDA)<br />Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) the amounts of selected nutrients considered adequate to meet the known nutrient needs of healthy people. The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). The Canadian equivalent is the Recommended Nutrient Intakes. RDA is generally accepted throughout the world as a valid source of information. At least 40 different nations have as well as organizations have published standards similar to the RDA.<br /><br />Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the body and is essential to good health. Approximately 50% of total body magnesium is found in bone. The other half is found predominantly inside cells of body tissues and organs. Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br />Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women. Magnesium is extremely safe by mouth - too much simply causes diarrhea. Try increasing the amount of magnesium you take by mouth until it causes diarrhea, then reduce the dose slightly so it does not. This is called taking magnesium to bowel tolerance (just like using vitamin C to bowel tolerance.<br /><br />Almonds are a good source of Fiber.<br />One ounce contains approximately 12% of the RDA for an adult.<br />So, in summary, Almonds are a very healthy snack, so what's left to say?<br /><br />Two things:<br />1st be cautious about ""bowel tolerance"" or ""happy bowels"" if you prefer.<br />2nd Taste.

I admit it.<br />Deconstituted peanuts - wow. Dry, tasteless, useless, but less fat.<br /><br />I have to say that I was wrong!<br />It smells pretty darned good when you open the jar up. It is powder, so<br />I used a knife to only cut half the lid off. That way, if my fumble fingers<br />dropped the jar, I would not spill as much of this - it is pretty pricey.<br /><br />I like peanut butters, but don't eat enough of it to really use it up before<br />it separates into oil/goo.  This is the answer for me. You just mix up what you need!<br /><br />Basically, this is just powder that mixes with water. While directions say two Tbls of powder<br />to one Tbl of water, who wants to really measure peanut butter? Best eyeball judging that I could<br />say for advice, is to get a small bowl, and put enough water in it to be about the amount<br />that you want to have of peanut butter. Use a spoon or fork, either one. Sprinkle the<br />powder over the water generously and mix, mix, mix. If it is too runny for your desired use,<br />sprinkle a little more powder and mix again. Repeat until it is just like you want it. I did find<br />that I had to mix it more than I thought I would to get the desired consistency/texture. If you<br />don't mix it enough, it will feel grainy to the tongue.<br /><br />The freedom to have it slightly runny for dipping, or thicker for spreading, is so nice!<br />While I honestly thought I wouldn't like it, I really do. I made a small batch up, intending to<br />dip my finger in it for taste testing. This is how I learned about not putting so much water in the bowl.<br />I had more peanut butter than I really wanted. So, son and I whipped out a package of Ritz crackers<br />and thoroughly enjoyed dipping/spreading it on the crackers. There was only the color of the bowl<br />left when we were through!<br /><br />If you've been on the fence about it, especially since it is a little costly, just jump in.<br />I can't see any waste in this product (except maybe spilling it).

It may be grain free, but food still smells, looks like, and fine details in label indicate ""highly processed"" with all the extra vitamins & minerals, which I think is the ""turnoff"" for the kitties. Doesn't say up front, but also contains New Zealand Green Mussell, which I am not sure how that ingredient fits in as I am not from New Zealand, but suspect locals rely on that for nutrients as we do mussells in this country.  They are spoiled on the real thing - minimally processed or raw rabbit, chicken, bird, wild caught salmon.  They will eat canned only if minimally processed.  Another cat food bites the dust but gives the dogs another treat! 1 STAR for not knowing about the New Zealand Mussell & for still being highly processed & therefore unpalatable as food for cats that love rabbit. 5 Star for a dog treat without the added hormones, grains, etc."

Excellent flavor and not so sweet as to make you feel you are getting a ton of sugar.  It has no added sugar and no corn sweetners, so, it is more natural than any other orange soda type drink.  More like a sparkling juice drink.  I have been a fan of orange juice and soda type drinks when as a kid I would mix OJ and Orange Soda.  Yet the natural taste of this drink is refreshing.  I tried it both with and without ice and although the iced version is more refreshing, if you get a very cold can of this drink it tasted very satisfying and did not leave you with an after taste or with the sugar blues.<br /><br />Caution, it has 34 grams of sugar, and although natural, you should check with a doc if you have sugar problems.  34 grams is equivalent to 5 or more teaspoons of sugar.  At least, if you like sparkling fruit drinks, check this one out.  I will next try it with added sparkling water to it.  Enjoy."

46401,B002GJ9JWS,AHOSY8W7EWK4O,A. Parker,24,24,5,1294099200,Peanut Butter Flavor without the Peanut Butter Guilt,"I love high-octane peanut butter, but not the fat/calorie content.<br /><br />TASTE: If you are accustomed to low-salt or raw products, the taste will be fine. If someone in the house balks at the taste, you can toss in a dash of fine sea salt or honey (agave works well too). You could easily mix PB2 with PB to wean onto this gradually.<br /><br />TEXTURE: Mixes fast and is very smooth (surprisingly). From the jar, it's similar in consistency to powdered sugar. Open factory seal on jar carefully so it doesn't fly out (trust me).<br /><br />MIXING: Easily mixes using a small spoon or spatula in a gently sloping small bowl (I use a pinch bowl)<br /><br />USAGE: PB2 has recipes on their website (Bell Plantation) and they also sell a chocolate/pb product. I'm a fan of straight PB2 (a spoon by itself) but have had PB2 on crackers, sprinkled on banana/apple slices, and am looking forward to making homemade PB2 ice cream this summer.<br /><br />STORAGE: I was a bit disappointed at shelf life projection.  As a dry product, it should last for years but the company says 10-12 months unopened and 4-6 opened. I would prefer to buy the larger sizes or a case to save more.<br /><br />COST: It can be obtained cheaper elsewhere (like on the PB2 website) but I had free shipping purchases to offset the cost. I wanted to try just one jar before committing to a larger sized container from the company. If you purchase natural products, the price won't be such a shock.<br /><br />BIGGEST PROS: lower calorie and fat content - hands down the best. Dogs like it too ;)<br />BIGGEST CONS: high cost and not a product you can 'make ahead' very successfully (though this could be considered a ""PRO"" because it helps with portion control. I make it as needed.<br /><br />This product will not change your life, but it will satisfy your peanut butter cravings."

We've tried the sweet potato and jalapeno flavors with less desirable results.  They taste too manufactured to us - the flavor is too intense.  We much prefer the basic original chip that remind us so much of Munchos.  They are nicely salty and have a great crunch.

The carbonation made the drink sparkling and energetic. Since I have recently kicked my 15 year habit of drinking Diet Coke, I have been looking for a substitute drink that wasn't straight fruit juice or straight soda. As an American I have become accustomed to thinking that carbonated drinks are the fun ones and that merely being healthy by drinking juice is boring. So Switch allows me to feel healthy and have some fun at  the same time while also giving up caffeine which I really don't want during the day.

For a while I despaired of getting them to eat wet food, as they would just sit there and lick up all the juices, without getting much of the meat.  Typical canned food is just packed too tight, and the texture is not amenable for breaking off little bits with just their tongues.  Finally, I tried out Spot's Stew, which solved the problem.  This food is much looser, I think due to the inclusion of peas and other veggies, and the meat part is just the right consistency where they can lick it up successfully.  At first the cats would eat around the veggies, but they now lick up every morsel, and even prefer the Spot's Stew over the Wellness pouches.  I also like that the food doesn't contain any fish, as one of my cats is allergic to something or other (his back legs are always itchy, and he'll pull out the hair), and the vet suggested it might be fish.

36649,B004CLCEDE,A3P8ACNCKHOZ06,Jessica Higgins,4,4,5,1341273600,Fantastic addition to stir-fry; delicious if you cook them right,"I heard about these noodles years ago through Hungry Girl, although they weren't available in my area's grocery stores until just a couple of years ago.  When I learned 2 years ago that I am gluten-intolerant (borderline celiac), I started using rice pastas and the like, but they weren't all that satisfying and still had a ton of calories and simple carbs.  Remembering the stories I'd read about shirataki, I thought I should give them a try.  I had initially tried a different brand (one of the tofu varieties).  I must admit, the first few times I tried shirataki noodles, I was really unimpressed, but I was pretty much just rinsing them and adding them to whatever I was making, but once I learned how to properly cook them, even the other brand was really good.<br /><br />The best way to prepare them that I've found is a little bit involved, but they are still very quick and simple.  I put about a teaspoon of oil (grapeseed) in my 9"" nonstick wok and preheat it on high.  I open the package of noodles directly into a colander, letting the liquid drain out (it smells a little like shrimp to me, but YMMV), and then open up the hot tap over them for a couple of minutes.  I then shake/squeeze out the excess water, sometimes blotting on some paper towels, then snip them with kitchen shears until they are a more manageable length on average (although sometimes I do this directly in the pan, just because I'm weird and that seems fun).  Transfer the noodles to the pan.  The oil should be hot and the noodles should sizzle when they hit the pan; grapeseed oil has a very high smoke point, which is why I prefer it for stir-frying.  I tend to use silicone-covered kitchen tongs for cooking my noodles, as it seems easier to grab them and turn them than trying to just stir.  I let them cook for a couple of minutes until they are more or less dry, then add my other ingredients in order of how long they take to cook.  You really can't overcook shirataki noodles (in my experience), though - they don't get soggy like wheat pasta.<br /><br />My favorite recipe is to add 6 oz. medium raw shrimp (usually I just rinse/thaw the shrimp and noodles together in the colander, then separate them as even raw shrimp doesn't take very long to cook), 1/2-3/4 cup of chopped green onion, 2-3 tsp of liquid aminos (or light soy sauce), a beaten egg or two, and a dash of ginger & garlic powder at the end.  The noodles take a back seat to whatever ingredients you add, and are just a nice addition that also tends to be very filling.  I calculated this recipe in a diet log, and it checks in at under 400 calories for what amounts to a HUGE bowl of noodles with 6 oz. of shrimp and two large eggs.  Tons of protein and very filling for very few calories.  Even my exceedingly picky husband likes them, and he isn't rummaging through the fridge & cupboards 10 minutes later like usual.  Last night I added some frozen grilled red & yellow peppers in place of the shrimp, and it was outstanding.<br /><br />I like these because they are not only gluten-free, but soy-free.  While I don't actively avoid all things soy, I do try to keep my intake in check, mostly because of how ubiquitous it is in nearly every other prepared food product (especially gluten-free).  I'm still curious about the nutrition measurements, considering the package describes them as being made of soluble fiber, but lists &lt;1g of fiber in a serving.  In any event, I am always full and happy after a meal containing these."

One ounce contain approximately 20% of the RDA for an adult recommended dietary allowance (RDA)<br />Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) the amounts of selected nutrients considered adequate to meet the known nutrient needs of healthy people. The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). The Canadian equivalent is the Recommended Nutrient Intakes. RDA is generally accepted throughout the world as a valid source of information. At least 40 different nations have as well as organizations have published standards similar to the RDA.<br /><br />Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the body and is essential to good health. Approximately 50% of total body magnesium is found in bone. The other half is found predominantly inside cells of body tissues and organs. Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br />Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women.

Do to a severe sensitivity to caffeine and any sort of stimulus, I wanted to try something natural that would not raise my pulse, quicken my MVP heart and just not make me overall jittery.  These do the trick.  When I drink a meal replacement drink, I still feel hollow inside and want to snack.  By adding a full, rounded table spoon of seeds after a few minutes, I feel nice and full.  These can be tossed into a powdered drink, a canned ready to go drink (milkshake type) and even into a vitamin water.  But believe me when I say, you must consume quickly or you will need a spoon, they turn into a jello consistency quick....which actually is not bad either.

I have used it both in chili and marinara sauce.  I plan to try adding it to my lentil veggie burgers where I think it will work fine.  I have been pleasantly surprised by this product and would recommend it to anyone that is trying to reduce the saturated fat that his or her family is consuming.

All you do is add this syrup and it's great.  Great to add into iced tea too.<br /><br />Get the pump if you think you will use it to sweeten by the glass.  Otherwise you can just pour out of the bottle for larger batch drinks.  It's also really good to add into whipped cream if you are making that from scratch - but I actually prefer to use the vanilla flavored Monin for that.<br /><br />Monin syrups are high quality - I've been using them for years in my coffee (caramel, vanilla, almond, etc.) and the fruit flavored ones to make Italian sparkling sodas."

They LOVE it and will do just about anything for it, so it is a great treat to use for training.  (Powdered freeze dried liver is even added to many dog medicines nowadays-- heartworm and arthritis tablets, etc.-- because it causes the dog to scarf the medicine down like a treat.)<br /><br />Freeze dried liver has a dry, hard, yet powdery/easy to chew consistency.  It comes chopped/cubed.  It is extremely lightweight due to the fact there is so little moisture in the product (thus the low weights on product labels).<br /><br />Even though your dog will love liver treats, you shouldn't overfeed it.  The manufacturer recommends 1-2 cubes daily for small dogs, 2-3 cubes for medium dogs, and 3-4 cubes for large dogs.<br /><br />The largest package sizes of liver treats tend to be far more economical.  I recommend buying the larger tubs, as you will save lots of money, you'll have a handy treat supply around for a longer time, and your dog will never tire of this product.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />Here's the nutritional analysis:<br /><br />-100% freeze dried liver<br />-NO additives or preservatives.<br /><br />-Crude protein..... not less than 50%<br />-Crude fat.....  not less than 5%<br />-Crude fiber.....  not more than 3%<br />-Moisture.....  not more than 6%"

I think a lot of people who are not used to low-carb protein bars do not have the experience with these types of bars, so they make comparison to regular bars out there that have upwards of 25 grams of sugar per serving.  Of course sugar makes everything taste good, but that's definitely not my goal nor the goal of other low-carb eaters out there.

Also this oil seems to withstand high heat without burning. In my house we use it all the time for many different dishes. Sesame oil contains vitamin E which is an anti-oxidant. This means it helps lower your cholesterol.<br /><br />I like to cut up broccoli, peppers (green and red), brussel sprouts and a chicken breast. Then I add soy sauce, hot sauce, ginger & garlic paste, water and of course sesame oil. You only need a little sesame oil. Less is better here because if you put too much the sesame oil will overpower the other flavors. A teaspoon or a little less is just right. This makes a quick tasty meal when mixed and stirred in a hot pan on high heat. It only takes about 10 minutes and serves at least 2 people. Very simple and quick meal that tastes great with sesame oil.<br /><br />I'm sure there are loads of tasty sesame oil recipes. All you have to do is search the internet and you'll be busy for hours if you like to cook. The main thing is to use it sparingly. This oil is dark, rich and very tasty."

I/D was also more expensive than Newman's at my local vet's office. I have had a ton of issues getting my dog to accept other dog foods in the past. We tried pretty much every brand that you can buy in pet shops and always had problems with my dog scratching or having her ears get bright red. We found out the problem after one of the cases where she almost went into renal failure after eating her Milkbone treats. We needed something organic without a lot of beef in it. While this one does have some bi-product for protein, it doesn't seem to bother my dog at all. She also has normal stools every time which wasn't the case even with the I/D. My dog hated the I/D. She would often leave a good portion of it on the ground or in the bowl and rarely ate it in its entirety. With the Newman's own it is night and day. She scarfs it down in less than a couple minutes and usually eats a bowl in one sitting. It seems like she loves it from the way she eats it.<br /><br />A couple of the reports from reviewers originally scared me about the reports of scratching which was exactly the problem I had with other dog foods. I gave it a try and my husky has never had a problem since and she has been on it for almost three months now. My husky has always had problems with digestive issues and this seems to be one dog food that she likes and does not have problems with.<br /><br />On a side note, I wish Newman's offered a bigger size bag. I have to order these all the time due to the 12.5 pound bag. My husky kills a bag in roughly two weeks due to her size. It still works out being cheaper than the $50 bag of 17 pound I/D I was ordering so I'm still happy with it. Science diet was sending me to the poor house."

The only places that I could find it online were in other provinces- and they would not ship to Montreal. (nor was it cost efficient for me)<br />Then a month ago- I was shopping in one of our largest grocery stores (IGA Select) and found it in their health section....but at over $3.50 for a small bottle- as much as I liked it- it was a little steep.<br /><br />Then I found it on Amazon- probably at the best price you can find anywhere; and even with free shipping. (They dont ship to Canada either- but I have it shipped to a USA address and a friend brings it home for me. This friendly service costs me a few bottles for sure- but well worth it!!!)<br /><br />My fridge is happily stocked with an assortment of ALO flavors; and needless to say-I have been, and will continue to; order a case or more per month!<br /><br />I am very much looking forward to trying their new flavors!!!"

The tea is fresh so it will last a fair amount of time and the price is the best I have found short of walking into an ASDA in the UK!  480 Tea bags is not that much when you do the math.  One in the morning, another around lunch, and another in the afternoon, three bags a day (so far). Then a friend pops by and there goes two bags, if they stay a while another or two, lets count two bags once a week for friends.  That makes 21 for the regular week, add two more you have 23. One box lasts 10 weeks, and if you have friends over after church the extra 10 goes quick. So this is only 20 weeks of tea, and it is still fresh and before the best by date!<br />I am retired Military and can shop on base.  The tea on base is not as fresh as these, and the price is more also.<br />Again, I ask, What more can a person ask for when they have a good cuppa in their hand?"

36651,B004CLCEDE,A1T0KASKIA765N,Kristen,4,4,5,1338595200,Pretty darn good for what it is,"I first heard about this product perhaps six months ago, after reading a lukewarm review of it on a website. Out of sheer curiousity, I came to Amazon and discovered lots more lukewarm reviews, along with a few scathing and a few glowing ones. At the time I didn't have any particular need for zero carb pasta in my life, so I just kind of laughed at how goofy it was and forgot about it.<br /><br />That was then; this is now.<br /><br />I have since read several books and a myriad of articles in support of a low-carb diet for weight loss, improvements of blood pressure and cholesterol levels, and prevention/improvement of diabetes. For the sake of my own long-term health and vitality, I became convinced that a low-carb diet is my best chance. Of course the catch is that one cannot return to the normal American diet after the initial objectives have been achieved--it must become a life-long way of eating. In other words, bye-bye pasta, along with almost all my other favorite foods.<br /><br />But then I remembered the shirataki noodles and figured it was worth a try, even though my expectations were really low. I'm not sure how they make a pasta-like food product from nothing but water-soluble yam fiber, but they are remarkably like regular Asian glass noodles when prepared as directed on the package. Last night I fried up some meat in some peanut oil, threw in some frozen broccoli, added a bit of soy sauce and a little peanut butter, and then, after rinsing and boiling them, added the Miracle Noodles. Yum! As advertised, I found the noodles really didn't have a flavor of their own but took on the peanut and soy sauce flavors beautifully.<br /><br />They do stick together, so it requird a knife to cut off bite-sized pieces, but wow. Loved it!! And the addition of the Miracle Noodles also made the meal more filling than it would have been otherwise.<br /><br />Bottom line: If you're low-carbing it like I am, you gotta try this."

I am generally a fan of flavored coffees and this sounded good, so I bought an 18 cup pack. I have to say it is delicious! The coconut flavor is light but definitely there, and doesn't leave a bitter aftertaste like most black coffees do. It smells so good my co-workers have done a 180 walking by my desk to ask me what smells so good.<br /><br />Obviously if you're a coffee connoisseur this won't be for you, but if not it is definitely worth a shot.

I have no idea why - salt and vinegar chip lovers are very devoted to their favorite flavor (as illustrated by me actually desperately writing to Pringles!). Anyway, I gave this brand a try and I am really happy with it. It has a nice strong flavor and a light crispy crunch. It have tried the Salt and Vinegar Pirate's Booty, which was ok, but more like a cheese puff and the flavor was a little strange.

I've had my dog Brandy on Eagle brand dog food for many years.  I remember when there was the melanine scare, but I didn't have to worry because all of the ingredients were natural and were grown in the United States.  Aside from that, once I changed from an inexpensive food with suspect ingredients, there was a very noticeable difference in her general appearance, especially her fur.  It became sleek and ultra shiny and her body slim and trim.<br /><br />Brandy is now eleven years old and although I cannot credit Eagle for her health, she has had only one minor incident that she's had to be taken to the vet's for outside of regular checkups.  My veterinarian wholeheartedly approves of her diet and is pleased that even though she's getting to be an old girl, she's amazingly healthy.  I used to use another Eagle brand, but since she's getting older,  I switched to the senior brand.  She's getting a tad chunky, but her activity level has changed.  Brandy still is frisky and I do believe a good diet has a lot to do with it.<br /><br />When my vet called me the other day with some test results from another dog, I asked her about the corn in this food.  Everyone is yelling about corn being a poor and unhealthy filler so I couldn't resist asking.  She simply said that she considered corn a vegetable and had little bad to say about it.  In other words, a not to worry situation.  My dog is happy, healthy, and I heartily recommend Eagle Pack Senior for all older dogs.<br /><br />INGREDIENTS:<br /><br />Chicken Meal, Ground Brown Rice, Ground Yellow Corn, Oatmeal, Chicken Fat (Preserved with Natural Mixed Tocopherols), Pork Meal, Brewers Dried Yeast, Dried Beet Pulp, Anchovy & Sardine Meal, Flaxseed, Dried Egg Product, Wheat Germ Meal, Potassium Chloride, Carrots, Peas, DL-Methionine, Vitamins [Vitamin A Supplement, Vitamin D-3 Supplement, Vitamin E Supplement, Riboflavin Supplement, Vitamin B-12 Supplement, d-Calcium Pantothenate, Niacin Supplement, Pyridoxine Hydrochloride, Thiamine Mononitrate, Folic Acid, Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C), Biotin], Minerals [Polysaccharide Complexes of Zinc, Iron, Manganese and Copper, Cobalt Carbonate, Potassium Iodate, Sodium Selenite], Choline Chloride, Dried Kelp, Lecithin, Rosemary Extract, Glucosamine Hydrochloride, Yucca Schidigera Extract, Dried Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Enterococcus faecium, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus licheniformis, Aspergillus oryzae and Aspergillus niger Fermentation Products, Mixed Tocopherols (a natural preservative).<br /><br />GUARANTEED ANALYSIS:<br /><br />Crude Protein (min.)  26%<br /><br />Crude Fat (min.)  12%<br /><br />Crude Fiber (max.)  3.00%<br /><br />Moisture  (max.)  10.00%<br /><br />Calcium (min.)  1.00%<br /><br />Phosphorus (min.)  0.080%<br /><br />Vitamin A  (min.)  22,000 IU/kg<br /><br />Vitamin E  (min.)  165 IU/kg<br /><br />Ascorbic Acid (min.)  30 mg/kg<br />(Vitamin C)*<br /><br />Omega 6 Fatty (min.)  2.40%<br />Acids *<br /><br />Omega 3 Fatty (min.)  0.60%<br />Acids*<br /><br />Glucosamine  (min.)  340 mg/kg<br />Hydrochloride<br /><br />Total Lactic Acid  (min.)  100,000,000<br />Microrganisms*<br /><br />(Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Enterococcus faecium in equal amounts)<br />*Not recognized as an essential nutrient by the AAFCO Dog Food Nutrient Profiles<br />Eagle Pack Senior Adult Dog Food is formulated to meet the nutritional levels established by the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) Dog Food Nutrient Profiles for maintenance.<br /><br />FEEDING GUIDELINES (from the website):<br /><br />Transitioning to Eagle Pack¬Æ<br />It is important to slowly transition your dog from his/her current diet as it takes a few days for the body to adapt to the new nutrient levels.

Perfect for us, since we like variety! The drawer doesn't pull completely out, but has a built-in stop; it doesn't seem to make it harder to get the last K-cup out, at least for me. I'm a female with average lady-fingers. YMMV. Still, I like the stop, I wouldn't want to have K-cups rolling all over the kitchen floor.<br /><br />Note - if you keep your machine under upper cabinets, you'll likely need to pull it out away from the wall to allow enough clearance to insert K-cups and fill the reservoir.

Instead of struggling with her to get them down, she actually DROOLS when I get the pill pockets out. I do recommend giving your dog a couple of them without the pill beforehand, because my dog usually spits out any new treat the first time, sniffs it out, chews it, etc.  Now she just gobbles it up. They easily mold around the pill, and I do follow the directions (not touching the pill pocket with the fingers that touched the pill).  Anyways, it's been a week, so hopefully the success will continue. GO PILL POCKETS! (lol)<br /><br />Edit: It's been 3 weeks, and still a success.  I don't even do the ""not touching the pill pocket with the fingers that touched the pill"" thing anymore.  Plus, I now break off pieces to fit around the small pills, and 1 large capsule pill pocket can be split to mold around 2 capsules, although this will vary in others."

I would like to say that the product has worked perfectly.  Maybe the issue with some users is that they are not pressing the lid on tight enough or are not allowing the filter to hang over the edge and be sealed in place by the lid.  There was NO leaking at all and I have used 10 cups already.  I also read that the coffee does not seem to be as strong as regular brew.  That is true, probably due to the type of grind.  My resolution to the issue is to have a regular coffee cup in place, but choose the smallest cup on the Keurig, which gives you roughly half a cup of coffee.  Lift the handle as though you are going to remove the kcup and just push it back down and brew a second tiny cup into the already brewed cup.  Viola!  Perfect.

There's just something about the perfect combination of texture and bite that make chowing down on chewy fruit-flavored candy a happy activity.<br /><br />Strawberries are one of my favorite fruits so naturally I was overjoyed when I found out many years ago that Haribo made a gummi strawberry candy that, as a bonus, even looked like the fruit it was trying to imitate! They obviously don't taste like actual strawberries which have a sort of tartiness to them, but they do taste as good as if not better than any other imitation strawberry flavor out there.<br /><br />These candies are so good I can just munch on them - two or three at a time - for hours (which I guiltily admit I have done in the past at work).

I can, however, report what I have learned.<br /><br />I discussed the pros and cons of Dreamfields pasta products with my gastroenterologist.  To begin with, he tells me that this is the only pasta he eats at home.  It leaves him without the gassy, bloated feeling associated with other pastas.  (I also find this to be true.)  When I questioned him about a reviewer's findings that, acids (tomato sauce) change the ability of this pasta to remain a low-carb food (and thus, rendering its claim to be invalid), he told me that this makes no sense.  Tomato-based products are low acid.  Our bodies' own digestive acids are extremely strong.  If they weren't, we would be unable to properly digest our food.  As the pasta passes through the stomach and intestines, the carbohydrate level does not increase.<br /><br />For those who are gluten intolerant (Celiac disease), this is not a gluten-free product.  But, for those of us who mildly react to gluten, you may be pleasantly surprised at how well your body tolerates Dreamfields pasta.<br /><br />Eating this pasta product in normal quantities (2 ounces dried), as with any pasta product, is important.  If we follow the example of Italians, pasta is only a small portion of the meal.  To eat a large portion of pasta without also consuming a helping of vegetables, a salad, and a protein, is not healthy.<br /><br />As for texture and taste, Dreamfields pasta is excellent.  It looks, feels, and tastes like any regular brand of pasta.  You can use it as you would with any of your pasta recipes.  With the A+ rating it gets from my doctor, this will be our brand of pasta from now on."

I made the mistake of getting this package-- didn't realize it was the espresso grind--it is pretty fine, and I was using a strainer at first and now a french press, neither of which removes all the tiniest particles. It works just fine in a drip coffee maker, though--I tested it with my mom's. I would get the coarse ground next time, though, since I don't have a drip coffee maker.

The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS).

At least 40 different nations have as well as organizations have published standards similar to the RDA.<br /><br />Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the body and is essential to good health. Approximately 50% of total body magnesium is found in bone. The other half is found predominantly inside cells of body tissues and organs. Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br />Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women.

I love the fact you get all the different flavors and as of yet I have not found a flavor I did not like. Being from England I am very picky about my flavors of chips or crisps as I would call them as there seems to be such limited flavors but this box gives me flavors I can't complain. I also love the fact that 5% fat is the fat content which just makes them an even better snack. My only issue now is that I have to fight my husband and son over them because they love them just as much as I do. I have now had to go to a box a month but even then I am not sure I can have enough for the month with the three of us eating them every chance we can.

When I saw it on Dr Phil's show, I was curious, ordered it and was I HAPPY. Mixing it with water, the recommended serving is 1 point, regular peanut butter can be as much as 5 points. When using sugar free jam or syrup to mix the powder in, the taste is wonderful and has the consistency of peanut butter, thanks to whom ever developed this product,for someone like myself, trying to get healthier,well this is just a blessing. I encourage anyone who is a peanut butter lover like me, and would like to have the taste without all of the fat and calories, GO FOR IT."

There's chunks of veggies in there, which my cat surprisingly eats most of. When i was feeding him steak frites by Weruva, there would be a pile of just the veggies left behind when he was done. The peas are a bit hard, so that's the only thing he refused to eat in the can.

187,B000NY8ODS,A1IU7S4HCK1XK0,Joanna Daneman,2,2,5,1333843200,"Make a fresh fruit tart, light and beautiful","This packet of glaze is the secret to making those European style fresh fruit tarts. I am about to make one for a pie auction at church, after a friend requested that something ""strawberry"" should be offered. You can make the most amazing and relatively ""healthy"" fruit tarts by baking a base, layering it with uncooked, fresh, sliced fruit, then pouring over the made-up contents of one of these packets. They harden up at room temperature, hold the fruit together so you can slice the tart, and they let the beauty of the arranged fruit show through. I've also seen this glaze used over cheesecakes, to hold a fruit topping in place. Personally, I do not like cheesecake (too rich for me) but a fruit glazed cheesecake is gorgeous, I will admit. To do this, slice fruit and layer it on the cheesecake while it's still in the springform pan. Pour on the glaze, let it set up and then remove the springform. You'll have a clear layer of fruit on top of the cheesecake. Cherries, strawberries or sliced mangos are nice, but the best one I ever had used thin slices of lemons, that had been gently poached in sugar syrup before they were layered on the cake.<br /><br />I use a base of sponge cake, baked in a shallow form, but other bases can be pate sucre  (a kind of French pastry that is a bit like a sugar cookie) that works well in those fluted, straight-sided forms. You can also make mini-tarts in a muffin pan, pre-baking each mold with a layer of pie crust (even commercial crust works, though again, I prefer pate sucre, it holds its shape better and is more substantial and has a better crumb.) Just blind-bake the muffin tins lined with pate, then pop them out and fill with fresh fruits (berries are great) and pour over the glaze. Some people put a layer of creme patisserie, which is a pastry cream like custard but stabilized with flour,  below the fruit and I happen to think these taste best.<br /><br />If you get into baking, this glaze is a must-have on the shelf. The ingredients are vegan: tapioca starch, carrageenan, dextrose, cream of tartar, locust bean gum, so if you are looking to make a vegan tofu cheesecake, you can use this on top, as well as use it for fruit tarts with a nut crust base."
25625,B001BR9B92,A6NDFZI8IJSG9,Tim,1,1,5,1329004800,I'm in love.,"I was at Trader Joe's, randomly browsing at the deli meats section for something to munch on later when one of these individual links caught my eye. At first I thought the white on the outside was some sort of wrapping, but upon squinting I noticed that it looked like a residue.<br />""Hm. This is weird"", I thought. Maybe I'll eat it. Sorta like when you find strange crumbs on your kitchen table and stick it in your mouth when no one's looking.<br />So I bought a link, and read the information about Columbus Salame Secchi. Lo and behold, it's actually a sort of mold that grew on the outside of meat! Well I had already bought the thing, and figure I might as well eat it, strange as it may be.<br /><br />I was back at Trader Joe's the next day.<br />They had ONE left. My entire week was ruined!<br />So I did the only thing I could do. Buy it on Amazon!!!!!<br />The package of 12 links came two days ago. Went to the nearby hippie grocery store, bought some Cabernet, Stilton cheese, and imported Italian olives.<br />Wow...<br /><br />The flavor on this meat is just... irresistible. I know when people say something is irresistible, they mean it's really, really good. I actually mean this thing is impossible to resist. I always start eating a link with the intention of just having maybe a third or a half of a link, not because I'm a health nut or something, but just because I don't want to pig out on just some salami. This isn't just salami. This is Salame Secchi. Before I know it, I've eaten the whole darn link of sausage, and I'm feeling guilty not because I've eaten the entire thing, but because I have one fewer link left to eat later.<br /><br />The meat, mold, and fat in the salame come together in a joyful union taste-bud heaven. There's nothing else quite like it. I've always been a fan of salami and prosciutto, but you NEED to try this. If you've ever been a fan of smoked salmon, sashimi, or any kind of meat period, I think it will be impossible to turn this down.<br /><br />I'm ordering another 12 links ASAP."

I'm just saying that if you want to impress guests, just open up a bag of this stuff and the comments will roll in. The coffee itself is quite excellent, as you would expect. It has a nice aroma and a rich dark taste. My own tastes might prefer a slightly lighter roast, but that's only my own tastes and not the fault of the coffee.

I came a bit late to the natural litter party, because I was afraid natural litters would clump poorly/smell bad etc. Swheat Scoop is the second natural litter I've tried, and I had planned to try them all but this stuff is so great that I've decided there's no need to look further.<br /><br />There is no such thing as a cat litter that never smells bad, has no dust, never tracks at all, and produces clumps so perfect that they neither stick to the side/bottom of the box nor crumble apart a bit. That said, Swheat Scoop is the closest to perfect I've ever found, in ALL of these respects.<br /><br />Smell: Slightly ""barnyard""-like (it is wheat, after all), but I only notice it when I'm scooping out the box; if you scoop daily, you will not have an ambient smell. (We live in a 1-BR condo and the litter box is in the bathroom, so I would notice if there was a lingering smell.)<br /><br />Dust: Hands down, the least dusty litter (clay or natural) I've ever tried.<br /><br />Tracking: Minimal, on par with the lowest-tracking clay litters I've used, and superior to the lightweight (pine/cedar) natural litters. Swheat Scoop's consistency is quite like Grape Nuts cereal (sorry to gross out anyone who eats Grape Nuts), so because the granules are on the heavier side they tend not to track.<br /><br />Clumps: Not perfectly tight, but they can be scooped easily enough. With a high volume of urine, the clumps do stick to the bottom/sides a bit, but in my experience the tighter-clumping clay litters adhere MUCH more to the bottom and sides. (One of our cats pees a ton and the side-sticking drove me nuts with clay litter.) And as another reviewer mentioned, keeping the litter level high enough definitely mitigates this problem.<br /><br />I haven't experienced the bug problem others mentioned, but I'm willing to risk it considering how great this stuff is."

No offense to Pop Weaver popcorn because I think it also tastes great. But I like the flavor of the Great American popcorn better. As for unpopped kernels, yes there are unpopped kernels. I think there will always be unpopped kernels. The trick to good popcorn is to turn the heat off when the popping slows. That's where the unpopped kernels come from. I suspect you could get less unpopped kernels if you like burnt popcorn. As for the taste, I think the taste is pretty close to the theater popcorn. The only difference to me is no hot butter. If you want to go EXACTLY like a theater, buy one of those hot butter melters like the theater has. Otherwise it is a great tasting popcorn. The 8 ounce packets give you a lot of popcorn. I believe I remember the packets for the 8 ounce machine saying it has 10 ounces of popcorn in each bag. Great American popcorn from this store seemed to have the best price I could fine and (in my opinion) is definately better tasting than other types of popcorn."

Where black tea has the acidic taste of coffee and green tea has a very earth/leafy taste, white tea comes in as you would expect for its color. It is very light tasting with almost a lightly sweet maltiness to it. It doesn't have any of the harshness that you could find in black tea or coffee. And you can't really over brew it to release off-flavors as there is so little to the leaves. I find this tea works best for iced tea, it works well cold and has a much more refreshing flavor that other teas do on a summer day.<br />Of course there are there is the added benefit that it is good for you. If you want to try white tea, this is the product for you.<br />I purchased the organic version before I purchased this one.

The pancake batter before mixed w/ water smells like fresh baked sugar cookies. Then I added water and poured it into my waffle maker/grill. Cooked up fine with no graininess or lumps. I didn't follow the directions of 1 cup water to 1 cup mix. I just added water and stirred until I  got my desired consistency. My waffles looked like any other waffle. I poured my syrup and it was to my surprise delicious. Very light flavor. Not bitter or too sweet. I expected a strong bitter taste when I saw wheat flour and a gritty or graininess b/c it's organic but it's a smooth texture like ihop pancakes or regular pancakes. The vanilla and the honey in the mix give a nice mild taste to it without making the pancakes too sweet. I think the buttermilk they use makes the over all product not taste like cooked grain mush as well. I would definitely buy this mix again. I got the 3 pack for $11 through amazon's subscribe and save. I've heard 1 box can run you anywhere from $6-8. I'm not a big breakfast person, but will look forward to these 4 breakfast. My friend is a southern and he makes chicken and waffles with this mix , but he uses tofu instead of chicken though since he's vegan.<br /><br />p.s - be careful using oils such as olive and coconut that over heat to easily when using waffle maker or even on the stove.

I do not consume copious amounts of potato chips, however, I do occasionally pack my kids lunch with the salty tubers. My family enjoys the Popchips so much, that I purchased a variety pack of 24 (0.8oz bags) from Amazon.  They taste very good and the texture is wonderful, although I will admit they are a bit salty.  I really enjoy the salt and pepper flavor the best, with the salt and vinegar coming in a close second.

I took a bit of a haitus because I became an adult (sort of), and because the Bonomos stopped making it. But I never forgot the wonderful flavors and consistency of the taffy; my favorite was the bananna.<br /><br />So imagine my surprise when I saw Turkish Taffy for sale at our local County Fair last week! It was for sale for $1.59 almost 32X more expensive than it was thirty five years ago. But the flavor is right on (bananna and vanilla), and the consistency is excellent. I was able to break it up into nice pieces at room temperature with a few well placed whacks! The secret is to hit it several times at different places along the length of the bar against a hard, rounded or ""blunt"" object, such as the edge of a curb or a stair railing. Don't smack it against a flat surface. I was willing to overlook the incredible inflated price (Note; its cheaper here on Amazon - $1/bar if you get a 24-count box) and I enjoyed several bars.<br /><br />The only thing spoiling a very nice effort by the folks currently distributing the product is that the wrapper is all wrong. Either they didn't bother to do their reserach, or more likley, they are hoping we will overlook what is probably a large cost savings and manufacturing efficiency. Today's product is wrapped in a plastic sleeve that has a seam running down the back and is sealed on both ends. As millions of people my age know, this kind of wrapper makes it very difficult to get at the chunks, particularly the small ones, that you have just created inside the covering.<br /><br />The old wrapper was foil with the color matching the flavor on the outside (yellow for bananna, etc.), and silver metallic color on the inside. The metallic wrapper could be gently unfolded first on the ends, and then along the middle to expose 100% of the marvelous, freshly broken taffy...and then folded back up and stuffed into your pocket!! Very important for those quick getaways on your bike. (That might have had a bananna seat...)<br /><br />EXPLANATION OF STARS AWARDED:<br />**** for the effort to reintroduce Turkish Taffy + * for nice flavor - * for lousy wrapper + * for outstanding breakability = ***** Basically, the product quality trumps the lousy wrapper in my opinion, although I discovered its not a good idea to stuff a half-eaten bar wrapped in cheap plastic into your suitcoat pocket. So if you're listening Bonomo People, please bring back the foil wrapper. With the 20X price increase (based on Amazon's price for a box), there's got to be a little profit margin in there for the original, authentic foil. Really."

This Quaker product has a subtle aroma of maple and a hint of sweetness that enhances rather than overwhelms the oatmeal.  I did not find it at all artificial and there was no strange after taste.  My preference is always for longer cooking oats but busy mornings are not always conducive.  The consistency seems better when cooked in the microwave as opposed to pouring boiling water.  For a quick and healthy breakfast or snack, this is a good option."

I ordered this because the other reviews intrigued me, and I knew I wanted to gently support my liver & kidneys.  I'm not an expert on elimination or anything, but I feel like this makes those processes more effective.  Since last summer I've been on a mission to lose about 25 pounds, so I changed my diet and exercise habits, and lost 20 lbs by November; that seemed to be my limit and I was OK with it.  I started drinking this tea right after Christmas and after 2 weeks, I lost 3 lbs!  I know I probably shouldn't attribute this to the tea but it's the only change that I made to my routine... I wouldn't recommend this to anyone as a weight loss product but I mention it because it was an unexpected side benefit to me.  I think it does just make it so my body can get rid of waste more completely, on a consistent basis.<br /><br />It tastes good to me, earthy and mild... I like that it doesn't have as strong a licorice flavor like a lot of the Yogi Teas seem to, though it does contain licorice root.  I drink it plain, hot and strong, usually 2 teabags in a 20-oz mug or 1 bag in a smaller mug.  I like to drink it in the morning, and again in the late afternoon when I'm at work.  Since it doesn't contain tea, I like steeping it for even longer than 5 minutes to get the most out of it.  I usually take green tea in the morning, so I've been combining that with the Detox Tea but am going to try the Skin Detox Tea instead, to make it easier.  Also I feel the green tea detracts from the flavor of the Detox Tea somewhat although I still find it perfectly palatable.  Hope this helps!"

I use their Extra Bold Keurig K-Cups for my morning coffee, for example, and their salsa is a household staple. I like this too, although I will have to do some price comparisons the next time I'm shopping for chocolate. Nice that it's organic and rain-forest certified.<br /><br />This dark chocolate is 54% cacao, so not the absolutely darkest stuff out there. But it's good, has a rich chocolate flavor. Texture-wise, it's neither chalky nor oily -- that is, it seems to strike a nice balance in terms of the fat content. It leans toward the sweet side of the sugary vs. bitter scale, but not overly so.<br /><br />In short, well above average, unless your ""average"" includes boutique candies, handmade truffles, etc. Recommended!"

I think I can hear an inner voice of my mother telling me 60 years ago that I shouldn't like prepared foods, but I ignore that voice a lot. These are extremely easy to make (I heat my water for four minutes in an 1100 watt microwave), and they taste pretty good just as they are.<br /><br />Of course, I rarely leave things just as they are. I sometimes add in some milk with my water. It gives the potatoes a richer taste. I also dice various versions of Spam, mix in some canned string beans and pitted black olives, heat everything up, and mix it in with the potatoes. That way it becomes a quick and easy entree.<br /><br />I suppose homemade mashed potatoes have their points. Just try making them when you're over 60. This product starts looking pretty attractive at that point. And the texture is actually better than the best homemade potatoes I've had (most homemade versions usually just end up lumpy, though).<br /><br />Anyway, I recommend these. Don't pay attention to those inner voices telling you otherwise. This is a winner."

34092,B001216DGG,A1L56FN197JREO,E. Jamison,9,9,5,1297555200,Pricey but I'm Satisfied,"This is a nice bag of 1lb of different kinds of dried seaweed: wakame, aka funori, kiriboshi wakame, shiro kikurage, ito kanten, kizami hoshi kombu, according to the label.  I'm somewhat new to seaweed but there's definitely a nice variety of colors (red, white, clear, light green, dark green) and textures among the seaweed- it looks beautiful in a salad. Sixty-some dollars is alot for a pound of food but at 1/4 cup (dry) per serving of sea weed salad, this will last you a while: the bag says there's 90 quarter-cup servings in the bag.  The sea weed swells alot when soaked in warm water.  Also, I live in the middle of nowhere and I can't just run out to my local Asian supermarket to see if they have a similar product for half the price.<br /><br />The seaweed smelled nice and fresh, a gentle ocean smell- no stinky fish smell, no ""off"" flavor.  There's no sauce or seasoning on it, you make your own.  Unlike the limp salads made of wakame leaves, this seaweed mix makes a light and ""fluffy"", ""perky"" salad.  This product definitely makes a fancier, better seaweed salad than I've had at the 6 or 7 Japanese restaurants I can remember eating at.  Although, if you are looking for just dried wakame stems, this is not that product.<br /><br />I googled and found a dressing I really like, made of 3T rice vinegar, 3T soy sauce, 2T sesame seed oil, 1tsp sugar, 1tsp grated ginger, 1/2 tsp minced garlic, 2 chopped scallions, all just mixed together.  (The dressing even stays good in a cup in the fridge for a week or two!)  I soak the seaweed for 10 or 15 minutes in warm water, drain, mix in the dressing, and it's ready.  To make a small amount of seaweed stretch further, I serve it on top of shredded carrot and/or shredded radish.  (I got that idea from my local Japanese restaurant.)<br /><br />Unlike Emerald Cove's 3lb wakame product, which is made in China, this 1lb sea salad is a product of Japan. The website says that it is wild-harvested along Japan's coast.  It's imported by Great Eastern Sun from Ashville NC. The label lists no preservatives or anything besides seaweed as ingredients."

There is not one in my city, but whenever I travel to Minneapolis, I hit a Caribou at least three times a day.  My school librarian got a Keurig coffee maker and made me a cup of this stuff.  I was immediately hooked!  I started buying boxes of these K-Cups so I could enjoy Caribou coffee all day long while teaching, and now students see a smile on my face, cup in hand, and my coffee-fueled lessons have been taken to a whole new level.  While I'm brewing my coffee, I communicate more closely with the librarian, and this has resulted in some collaborative efforts between myself and the librarian, particularly concerning research, which in turn positively impacts the education of my students.  I savor every delicious drop of my Caribou coffee while the other teachers choke down the weak and bitter rat pee in the teachers' lounge.  Guess who looks forward to coming to work every morning?

Naturally, they also go down great with beer.<br /><br />As an Oregonian, I'm proud to share these delectable snacks with friends, especially those living outside our state and who haven't experienced gourmet chips. I tell them Kettle Brand does for potato chips what microbrews did for beer.<br /><br />Kettle Brand potato chips are unmistakable--a light gold color, rich flavor and amazing crunch. Kettle Brand chips are also a healthier snacking option than the major chip brands. Kettle Brand chips don't have trans fats, MSG or artificial flavors and colorings. The company also has a line of organic potato chips and all of their products are certified Kosher.<br /><br />I also recommend these other Kettle Chips flavors: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6MBUA"">Kettle Chips Sea Salt & Vinegar</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6Q4GM"">Kettle Chips Spicy Thai</a>.<br /><br />Annette Solomon, a reporter for the Salem Statesman Journal recently noted that a glass of wine goes nicely with these chips. Solomon wrote, ""...you could be missing out on a wonderful pairing. These chips are spicy, so you would want to select a semi-sweet white wine. Also, a moderate amount of acid will subdue the strong flavors of ginger, lime, garlic and cilantro without over-powering them. Classically, a German-style Riesling fits these parameters perfectly."""

I don't know where they find all the hermets to do this though.<br />As of this writing, a four-pound bag of Just a Wee Bit is a shade under 13 dollars at PETCO.<br /><br />Bella's Experience -<br /><br />In an impulsive frenzy, the Spudette fed Bella the new food right out of the bag with a little bit of Solid Gold canned food. Bad move. When introducing a new food, one should add a small amount of the new to the old and then gradually increase the percentage of new food in the mix until you reach 100% of the new stuff. Not surprisingly Bella got a bout of runny stools after this rude introduction to Just a Wee Bit.<br /><br />Within a week, however, Bella had adjusted to her new food and seems to be doing well on this new diet. I haven't smelled her stools to see if they are less odiferous and have no intentions of conducting such a test. As an added test, I put less than an tablespoon of the Solid Gold kibble on the plates of Evie and Piper. They actually seemed to like this new food quite a bit, even the ever-fussy Piper.<br /><br />Just a Wee Bit is the smallest dog kibble I have ever seen, and I've seen quite a few brands. Ever look at the little paper circles inside a whole puncher? Individual pieces of this kibble are almost as big as those paper cut outs and about as thick as a nickel. Be careful pouring this food because it's easy to drop a few pieces and almost impossible to find them. You'll have to rely on your dog's sense of smell to recover any dropped kibble. Occasionally Bella gets bits of this micro kibble caught in her throat making us think the tiny size of the pieces is too extreme.<br /><br />Finally-  I must admit that, based on the inclusion of wholesome ingredients and the exclusion of junk, this is an excellent dog food. Most dogs should thrive on such a recipe. One on a budget will probably prefer to find an alternate quality food that isn't so expensive. Since this formula is intended for dogs that have allergic reactions to some common ingredients in other foods, the extra expense really isn't necessary for dogs that have no such allergy problems. For hypersensitive Evie, this is a terrific choice. For dogs that can eat anything, it might be considered extreme."

Though sugar is the second ingredient, whole grain rolled oats is the first ingredient in every flavor of Quaker Instant Oatmeal, including this Maple Brown Sugar, which is a favorite of mine. Further, each serving (one packet) contains only four grams of sugar in the low sugar form and nine grams in the regular form, which is one to two teaspoons.<br /><br />Yeah, one or two teaspoons.<br /><br />I went through the rest of the ingredients on the Maple Brown Sugar flavor and on several others, and almost every other ingredient is an ingredient you'd find in a vitamin pill. The Apples & Cinnamon even has dehydrated apples (ahead of sugar, which is the third ingredient in that flavor).<br /><br />I'm recovering from chemotherapy and radiation. I had a bone marrow transplant in January (2012), and my new immune system sometimes goes after my gut when we lower my immunosuppressives. Thus, eating food that is high in fiber and gentle on the stomach and intestines is important for me. It's important for you, too, because the fiber in oats is excellent for your heart.<br /><br />The problem is, it's hard for me to find oatmeal edible without adding a lot more brown sugar than Quaker does! That's always been true, but it's especially true when I'm recovering from leukemia treatments. At first, there was a VERY limited set of food items I could eat without throwing up. (Sorry for being so graphic.) These flavored Quaker Instant Oatmeals let me eat gentle, heart-healthy oatmeal without hating the flavor. I love almost every one. They're a go-to food for me when I'm nauseous.<br /><br />I know you probably aren't recovering from a blood cancer, but if you're wanting to eat oatmeal because it's healthy, this is a great way to eat it.<br /><br />And for lazy people, it's a one-bowl cleanup. Pour the packet in the bowl, pour boiling water over it, and wait a minute (or less if you're impatient like me). Eat it, and you have one bowl and no pots to wash (or throw in the dishwasher)."

It really gives a nice chipotle kick which helps cut the sweetness of the pineapple. If you like chipotle, you should try this syrup. It could be adapted for use in any number of drinks. Plus, it is sweetened with cane rather than refined sugar or high fructose corn syrup. That alone made it an easy purchase for me. I have used about 1/3 of one bottle in making 6 or 7 mojitos so far. I am probably a bit heavy handed with my pour on this as I like the chipotle so much and these have been made in tall glasses. So, you should be able to get at least 20-25 drinks from a bottle--more if you are lighter than me on your mix.<br /><br />Update--I like my drinks really spicy so I was tending to overpour the Monin. Two problems there: uses too much syrup and it tends towards the too sweet side. My solution was to cut back on the Monin and sprinkle a bit of chipotle chili powder in my drink.

The moment you toss the bag in water and start to smell that intense aroma of fresh mint, you'll realize you've gotten not only a tea but an aromatherapy kit that'll have your whole house asking for their own cup.<br /><br />The tea itself is wonderful. You might not expect tea and mint to go this together, but they really do. The overall flavor that you get is a wonderful mouthful of mint flavor with just enough bitter tea to make it go down smooth. It really is a fantastic experience.<br /><br />If I had to come up with a downside, I'd say that the flavor is just a touch too syrupy. Anyone who's actually used fresh mint before will likely recognize this tea for what it is- an (excellent) mint syrup drizzled (deliciously) into a cup of tea. Basically, this is a really good approximation of mint infused tea, about as good as you could possibly expect from a bagged tea. For a product this wonderful you can't help but wonder what it would be like to have real leaves and brew them yourself. However, that's the trade-off you make for just being able to toss a bag in water and get your tea quickly. And having a tin of fresh leaves in this mix, you'd probably use it for the smell long before you considered drinking it anyway.<br /><br />In the end, this has instantly become my very favorite comfort tea. Especially if you're feeling a little under the weather, the smell solves a stuffy nose in no time. Definitely get a box and try this- maybe two boxes if you have other tea drinkers in the family, since they'll likely steal the first box for themselves."

It's a light black tea, with a nice easy flavor that has just a pinch of citrus. Steep it more lightly and you get an almost white tea flavor, longer to go darker. The only reason any tea enthusiast should be disappointed is if they prefer especially strong brews. My father-in-law is the type that would eat the leaves if he could, so he'd have to use extra bags to make the sort of insanely strong brew he prefers. Then again, that's why it comes in boxes of eighty.<br /><br />The actual flavor is perfectly balanced, and suits whatever bells and whistles you want to tack on. If you want to drink it as is, it's wonderful. It goes perfect with lemon, or with milk, and I've found it's also wonderful with honey and sugar. In short, this tea suits whatever you're in the mood for.<br /><br />I recommend this tea enthusiastically. I wound up picking up a box on clearance, and couldn't be happier. If you love tea, this is the perfect default to keep at hand when you can't decide which specialty brew to have. If you've never really gotten into tea, this is the pefect blend to learn what the fuss is about. This tea does lend itself more to afternoon and blending with milk or sweeteners, but it's fine in any situation."

One of the first things I noticed after baking with this flour is that I no longer ""bloated"" or had intestinal distress after eating the foods made with this flour. Soooo nice! My doctor recommended this flour to me, and I'm glad I followed his recommendation. I did an experiment to make sure that it wasn't a coincidence that after eating the Hodgson Mill Organic Naturally white flour I didn't bloat, become puffy, etc. I made some cookies and muffins using the Hodgson Mill flour, and I made the same cookie and muffin recipe with typical white flour (all the rest of the (organic) ingredients were identical). I had intestinal distress, bloated, and had facial and hand puffiness after eating the desserts with the typical flour. When the bloating subsided, I waited an additional 6-8 hours, and I ate the desserts made with the Hodgson Mill flour....nothing happened - no bloating, no puffiness, and I felt great. The Hodgson Mill flour makes you feel good after eating it. I'm delighted to find a flour that doesn't have an adverse reaction on me. ALSO! The flour bakes and cooks great. The texture is wonderful - actually better than typical flour. My cookies, breads, muffins, pie crust, brownies, gravy, etc come out wonderful with this flour. I receive a lot of compliments on my desserts when using Hodgson Mill organic flour. Sometimes people find it hard to believe when I tell them that the flour is organic and naturally white. They can't believe the flour produces such great results.<br /><br />The flour ships quickly and stores well on your pantry shelf. I keep it in the refrigerator after opening it.

It comes chopped/cubed. It is extremely lightweight due to the fact there is so little moisture in the product (thus the low weights on product labels).<br /><br />Even though your dog will love liver treats, you shouldn't overfeed it. The manufacturer recommends 1-2 cubes daily for small dogs, 2-3 cubes for medium dogs, and 3-4 cubes for large dogs.<br /><br />The largest package sizes of liver treats tend to be far more economical. I recommend buying the larger tubs, as you will save lots of money, you'll have a handy treat supply around for a longer time, and your dog will never tire of this product.<br /><br />There is really zero waste with this product.

After a few medical emergencies and educating myself WHY cats are not designed by Mother Nature to eat dry kibble (ANY brand), I changed our clan of felines to HEALTHY wet food.<br />Every cat with a blocked urinary tract is fine, until they start to strain to urinate and have to be rushed to the ER.<br />With all the issues of recalls and such concerning the pet food industry, we rotate 3 different brands of food. Felidae is one.  It has NO grains, soy, corn, or icky fillers. Felidae is a pate loaf-like consistency.<br />Since changing to a wet food only diet, none of our cats have been back to ER in years.  None throw up.  No runny eyes.  Coats are shiny. No matted hair.  All are at a perfect weight.  The changes are amazing.<br />Having 5 cats, I am VERY thankful for the 13 oz size cans of Felidae.<br />I had a question recently and sent Felidae an email.  They answered very promptly and were very kind.  Their customer service deserves 5 stars also."

Parisi ""Robert and Heather Parisi""",12,14,5,1132444800,SUPER NATURAL SUGER SUBSTITUTE + TERRIFIC BRAND,"EXCELLENT SUGAR SUBSTITUTE HAS HEALTH BENEFITS + NO WARNINGS,<br /><br />This ""NOW Stevia powder"" is good stuff and this among the most economical and user-friendly ways to buy Stevia.<br /><br />WHAT'S IT ALL ABOUT:<br /><br />Sweeter than sugar, that's what Stevia is, but that's not all.<br /><br />Stevia has been shown to lower blood sugar levels in research involving healthy adults by increasing the secretion of insulin making Stevia useful for diabetics.<br /><br />It also improves digestion and gastrointestinal function, and is useful for upset stomachs and to reduce gas and stomach acidity. Several recent studies have shown that it may improve the heart's muscle tone and promote the body's water loss. These properties are thought to contribute to lower blood pressure.<br /><br />Stevia also has antiviral, antimicrobial and antibacterial characteristics. It's used for relieving bleeding gums, sore throats and cold sores in South America and Japan. Stevia has been shown to inhibit plaque formation and bacterial growth causing gum disease and tooth decay, and will not cause cavities. It may even reduce cravings for sweets which coupled with its lack of calories may be helpful in weight loss.<br /><br />ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE SUGGESTS EVEN MORE:<br /><br />There is anecdotal evidence that Stevia is good for skin problems like acne, cold sores, dermatitis and eczema, and may speed up the healing of cuts and scratches. There have even been reports that Stevia may be useful as a contraceptive, but that has not yet been substantiated by research.<br /><br />FDA APPROVAL TO BE SOLD AS A FOOD SUPPLEMENT -- NOT A SWEETENER<br /><br />Most of all, Stevia, unlike the artificial sweeteners we put in everything from soda to psyllium does not come with any health warnings from the FDA, and it will probably do you no harm. However, Stevia has not been approved to be sold as a sweetener even though it is a NATURAL SWEETENER LIKE SUGAR. Nevertheless, Stevia has been approved [since 1994] to be sold as a dietary supplement in the United States.<br /><br />AFTER ALL THE SMOKE HAS CLEARED THIS IS FOOD - USE IT BY EATING IT!<br /><br />Stevia can be substituted for sugar. It is a bit different tasting if one is use to sugar. I use it on many things where I can eliminate large amounts of honey and/or sugar such as;<br /><br />1]- Herbal Tea, instead of sugar or honey.<br /><br />2]- In multi-grain hot cereal, when you need to sweeten it, Stevia saves me a tablespoon of honey and a tablespoon of sugar per large bowl. In this case I just add about a teaspoon of honey and 1/8 teaspoon of stevia for the same effect. Stevia is much sweeter than sugar so use about 1/10th as much in place of sugar.<br /><br />3]- Iced Tea.<br /><br />4]- Pancakes, waffles and French Toast as a replacement for some maple syrup.<br /><br />MEDICINALLY SPEAKING:<br /><br />A standardized extract of 57 mg. containing 85% ""steviocides"" in a beverage, is what Doctor James A. Duke, suggests in his famous, ""The Green Pharmacy Herbal Handbook"".<br /><br />ABOUT FORMS AND BRANDS:<br /><br />I prefer Stevia in powder over the packets, as I can better measure, and use what I need for each individual use. Purchase Stevia in whatever form you are most comfortable using.<br /><br />This ""NOW"" brand Stevia powder is an excellent product and a terrific value. ""Planetary Formulas Stevia Powder 3.5 oz."" is also excellent and it comes in a liquid as well. ""Swanson"" and ""Nature's Way"" are both excellent too, and have Stevia in powder, liquid and packets for convenient use. Any of the above choices are excellent, and I have used them all at one time or another, over the past 3-4 years on a daily basis.<br /><br />[I AM NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY PRODUCT OR COMPANY]"

I usually eat PB2 as a snack spread on a chocolate Vitatop muffin. I mix 1 tablespoon (22 calories!) with just enough water to make a good spreadable consistency, and then spread it on the muffin top. So yummy! I'm not sure why there are 10 or so one-star reviews... I guess if you are looking for the creaminess of peanut butter, then you won't like this because it doesn't have any oil in it. It's also more like natural peanut butter and not like Jif or Peter Pan, which have lots of added sugar. The powder also tends to repel liquids, so you have to treat it a bit like flour if you want to mix it into something else. Start by mixing a small amount of water with the powder until it loses the powdery texture, then add the peanut powder/water mixture to your recipe."

At 330 calories, 22 grams of fat, and 28 grams of sugar, it is still an indulgent treat, but if you choose to share the bar (as I did), you can satisfy your sweet tooth without feeling too guilty about it.<br /><br />I definitely enjoyed the taste of this bar as well; I found the chocolate to be rich and smooth.  At 54% cocoa, it is definitely not as dark as many other dark chocolate offerings out there--in fact, I found the taste to be a bit sweeter, more reminiscent of semi-sweet chocolate than true dark chocolate.  Although this was fine by me, some dark chocolate lovers may be disappointed.  So, unless you need your dark chocolate to be of the extra-dark variety, I would definitely recommend this product."

These are rather large biscuits that are made to break in half which makes them a perfect size for a snack or reward.  They have a good crunch which I think is good for dental health.  Anyway, I have a box of Alpo Variety Snacks and a box of Milk Bone Flavor Snacks to which I compared ingredients.  They both have artificial color, Alpo lists animal digest, whatever that is, while Milk Bone won the contest with all of those ingredients that no one can pronounce.  I would list what makes up all three but think it would not be too interesting and you probably have at least one of the listed brands if you give your pet treats.<br />What sets the Newman's Own apart is the simple list of Organic ingredients including lamb, carrots, apples, molasses, barley and tocopherols for Vitamin E.  It is made in New Zealand where they raise a lot of lamb, so this seems just the perfect place. The bottom line is our dogs think Pa and Nell Newman have a great product and would highly recommend it to their four legged friends.  Life could not be better than living with happy dogs.

It is not sour or bitter or anything of the sort; it is chocolate syrup that tastes like chocolate syrup.  A sugar high does not come with it (perhaps what the others don't like or are missing?) as Hershey's use erythritol--the exception to the rule--which is the only natural (or otherwise) sugar alcohol that does not cause diarrhea under any circumstances.  Now that in and of itself is reason to buy it for those out there with concerns about sugar consumption.  Most other products use maltitol (or any of the other sugar alcohols), which works better than any other laxative that I've tried.  In short, if you are a sugar-free fanatic, this is the product for you!<br /><br />A postscript--if you are not used to consuming sugar-free products, then it is going to taste odd in comparison to sugar-garbage.

Well, I can't comment knowledgeably on that, but I can say that the Bartolini brand is by far the best that we have tried, and tastes and smells strongly of truffle.  We use this primarily as a finishing oil, on risotto and scrambled eggs, where the quality of the underlying oil is critical, and have been really happy with the Bartolini oil.  I first used this product when living in London, and had friends bring some out for me when I hadn't been able to find a good alternative in the US, so am delighted to find this on Amazon.<br /><br />The oil is a bright yellow, and the base oil smells like a good quality extra virgin oil.  Each bottle at least has a small piece of truffle in the bottom, lending some support at least to the idea that the oil is infused.  If there is artificial flavor added, as some reviewers have suggested there has to be, then all I can say is that the resulting taste certainly doesn't have a chemical, or artificial taint, unlike some other brands we have tried.<br /><br />In particular, we have also used the Tourangelle brand, available in a tin from Amazon and Whole Foods, which is absolutely ghastly, and the quality of the oil used for that brand is appalling.  The end product is pale, tasteless and almost without any aroma, let alone that of truffles.  The presentation in a tin is unattractive and also lends the oil a somewhat metallic taint...just a generally awful product.  I guess they realize that the product looks so bad that if they put it in glass they'd never sell any of it.  Perhaps they think people are going to use it as a cooking, rather than a finishing oil, which is completely inappropriate....you could hope that heating it may burn off the dreadful chemical taint!<br /><br />So, if you're looking for a good option, that looks and smells good on the food, and at least gives the impression that it is a natural oil, I don't think you can go past this product."

I wanted to make an impression by sending her and her husband a nice present but not the usual (clothing, toys, etc). I decided to go with flowers but wanted to make sure they were the very best. I reviewed other roses suppliers and found out that Spring In The Air actually cuts the roses directly from the farm in Colombia and ships them right away via FedEx, while others are just waiting for orders to come in and their inventory is sitting in a warehouse somewhere in the USA.<br /><br />With that said I was sure that my roses were going to live even longer. Probably a week or two more, compared to other roses bought at Amazon. In addition, for the price my bet was that they were going to be top quality. So I gave them a try.<br /><br />The results: they exceeded my expectations and raised the bar.

I was relieved. The plan worked perfectly!<br /><br />Thank you Spring In The Air. I will surely buy from you again. Please keep up the good job, great service and outstanding roses you have."

There's no way I can choke down cooked oat meal; eating oatmeal cookies, on the other hand, is something I can swallow.  All of Erin Baker's cookies appear to be made with oatmeal, and the three that I've tried are palatable enough.  Nevertheless, the Fruit & Nut flavor was the one flavor of the three that I most looked forward to savoring each morning (I hope it wasn't because of lower oatmeal content than the other three).<br /><br />In short, you don't have to be the Cookie Monster to like these. Nor do you--despite the ""Fruit & Nut"" flavor--have to be a little ""fruity"" (to quote Norman Bates' audible thoughts in Hitchcock's ""Psycho"") or a ""health nut"" to find these tasty and nutritious--maybe even therapeutic (Dr. Esselstyn would seem to think so).

My 50 pound dog has a weight problem, and these are the only treats I can use to reward him for obedience multiple times a day.<br /><br />The biscotti don't crumble in my  pocket on a walk, and my dog even sniffs my pockets at home to ask for another one. Even though the treats are tiny, he doesn't swallow them whole. He chews them--maybe to savor them. I also put these in his <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0038WP1YC"">Ethical Pet Seek-A-Treat Shuffle Bone Dog Puzzle</a> as a reward, and he solves his puzzle with enthusiasm. Even though my dog weighs 50 pounds, one 8 oz bag lasts about a month.<br /><br />My dog has no diagnosed allergies, but his gasto-esophgial system was sensitive and irregular starting from the time we rescued him. For his weight-loss, I switched his food to <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003P9XFV4"">Blue Buffalo Longevity Dry Food for Adult Dogs, 24-Pound Bag</a>, which has no soy, wheat, corn, by-products, or preservatives. His gastro-esophogeal system happened to improve a lot and became regular. The hypo-allergenic treats did not cost much more than the regular ones at the time I first bought them, so I figured I would be safe and buy them. My dog hasn't had any problems on these treats, but the change in food might also explain it.  I'm sticking with the hypo-allergenic even though it's not eligible for free shipping.<br /><br />Having said that my dog likes these treats a lot, these are not his very favorite.  I give him a medium-sized biscuit <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00027D3QO"">Nutri-Vet Breath & Tartar Spearmint & Parsley Flavored Biscuits, 19.5 Ounce Bag</a>every few days, and he goes absolutely crazy for it. Alas, the biscuits have too many calories for me to treat him more often. I'd say my dog would rate his biscuits 10 barks for taste, whereas he would give his biscotti a solid 7 barks.<br /><br />Because the biscotti treats are tasty, made with wholesome ingredients, and very low in calories, I rate them 5 stars.  I consider liver biscotti a good investment in my dog's health. Every dog should have liver biscotti as his or her go-to treats."

My dog heard the package rustling though and immediately ran over to see what I had. When I held a piece out to her she was reluctant; she sniffed it thoroughly and acted like she wasn't going to eat it. No surprise there, she likes very few treats. I haven't had much luck testing out pet products on her, as she is so picky. (You wouldn't think a mutt who ate trash for months as a stray would be this picky but she is) She decided though that she wanted this treat: she snapped it out of my hand and ran behind the couch to eat it, so that no one could even *think* of taking it from her. Normally she just takes her favorite treat a few feet away from me, so the fact that she ran and hid to eat this means a lot.<br /><br />My elderly (15 year old) cat even showed an interest in these, which is not normal for her in the least.

Scanlon ""least helpful reviewer""",7,15,5,1261699200,At last we find a food fit for human consumption,"And we find her here upon this grand amazon!<br /><br />Each day Morinu feeds me like my own nourishing mother, cherishes and consents my whims with this wonderful food.<br /><br />Eschew all animal byproducts and cadavers.<br /><br />This tofu is a strengthening food, fit for human consumption.<br /><br />And so convenient from our mighty amazon, sent right to your front porch or, in my case, post office box with free shipping rather than driving thirty to seventy five miles for the same product at three times the price, plus gas.<br /><br />This is fit food for humans, food for which our bodies are created, food which feeds us rather than kills both the source and the consumer.<br /><br />You may read here written by the self-deceived that this tofu is too mushy for firmness and that it must be pressed between towels before cooking. To them so confused I ask<br /><br />Cooking?<br /><br />Each day at least once a day, I draw forth my serrated knife, and one sacrificial box of this excellent tofu, and I without remorse slice a hole in its top, with great tenderness and care and gratitude, releasing only the slightest and most apologetic gentle spurt of clearest liquid.<br /><br />And this with a certain yearning.<br /><br />I do not observe the indications written sternly upon the short edge of the box, but lie this box gently down upon a smooth flat slab of wood, with the face up, and take the knife very gently sliding upon on edge of the top, the very belly of the box, and then upon the other edge of this top, and then most gently along the bottom edge of this top, each time releasing apologetically the slightest hint of a clear liquid, revealing thusly by means of these three slits the gentle hidden secrets of the box, the soft white substance lying shyly within, awaiting with embarrassment our further processing.<br /><br />I feel the need to explain this procedure with greater care and attention. The very tip, the point of the knife, uncovers tenderly a certain point a certain distance from the corner of the broad top of the box, the side with the picture and product label, as pictured here, the side which reads Morinu, the broad flat side laid flat. The very tip of the knife, I say, discovers probingly a certain point near one corner which offers the proper resistance without too great a resistance, without too little a resistance, to penetrate this membrane. Too close to the corner is found to be too hard, too resistant, too unwilling, although most convenient for the later proceedings. Too distant from the corner implies simply random slashings without specific purpose, and our purpose in this procedure is most serious, most purposeful, intent.<br /><br />In a word therefore the point of the knife penetrates the membrane slowly yet purposefully as close to the corner as possible, penetrating as deeply as possible without piercing the wooden slab beneath. A certain spurt of clear liquid may emerge, but let this prove no inhibition, as the knife reaches the depth of the box. Slowly withdraw the knife, slowly, at a diagonal, allowing the serration softly with friction to continue to separate a slight slit along the ege of the box, slowly, resolutely but patiently, with purpose, as the serration creates an ever longer slit along that edge, as closely as possible.<br /><br />Continue from this first slit along the the contiguous edge of the top of this box, and then the third edge, inserting carefully your knife, and slowly withdrawing with a friction sufficient to separate the membrane without shredding, without eliciting over muchly the clear liquid which may spurt forth.<br /><br />Let us call the top right corner of the box Point A, the bottom right corner Point B, the left bottom corner Point C and the upper left corner Point D. Begin to pierce at Point A, proceed in turn to B, to C, ending at D, forming this a slit along the three edges. Arriving at Point D, withdraw the knife completely, wipe the blade with a soft, dry cloth and set it aside for cleansing. We now may lift the flap thus created, exposing the delicate white contents within.<br /><br />I feel remiss if I do not address a probable misconception here writtenonly for the rhetorical convenience, and I feel compelled by the necesity of correcting this counter-indication, no matter how unclear this may be, due only to my severely limiting literary incapacities.<br /><br />Employing the same alphabetical coordinates as described above, the consumer may discover this procedure far more efficacious: to begin at Point A and proceed gently yet firmly to point B as described. Divergently, however, please proceed to point D (!) and then directly by knife edge to point C, parallel to the Line AB already created, yet along the opposing edge. Having thusly formed two parallel slits, find the midpoint between Point B and Point C as close to the edge as possible, probing and then plunging the tip of the knife through the cardboard membrane, through to the bottom of the box, but now with an orientation perpendicular to that previously used in the formation of lines AB and DC. Withdraw slowly, delicately, yet with sufficient friction at an angle to proceed effectively to the corner at Point B. Withdraw completely and reverse the knife blade, returning it deeply at the midpoint previously entered. Withdraw once more with similar care, and opposite diagonal, completing the slit thus formed entirely to Point C. I am confident the consumer may discover this procedure far more delightful and effective than any here previously described.<br /><br />Firmly we roll back the top flap created by the three slits. Proceed mercilessly, proceed, not frenetically, but ardently nevertheless, to dice within the selfsame box her contents, slowly, gently, but decisively. The fresh tip of my serrated knife, which in recent memory has touched no animal part, but vegetable alone, and never shall become so adulterate with the blood of the animal, with the dairy of the animal, this sanctified and reserved and faithful tip, having never known in any sense animal but only vegetable, purified thus, unadulterate, this sacred knife dares therefore pierce this gentle pure white tofu into a ruthless grid of slits, fully through to the bottom box, plunging first vertically in rhythmically repeated rows spaced gently a few centimeters apart, and then, relentlessly, horizontally, pushing ever so softly through the yielding, unresisting white tofu laid back upon the flat slab, awaiting without a word this process, with utter patience, yielding.<br /><br />Completed this repeated slicing, back and forth, up and down, across, and through, and through, I lift in one hand upwards the entire box gently, yet unrelentingly, over the recipient reserved for this purpose alone. Most often it is the daily lunch container, reusable, with soft top, to receive the more securely and gently this daily offering, removed demurely from its box, as cautiously as a hermit crab from its borrowed shell, vulnerable by exposure. With one finger one may remove whatever residue remains relunctly within the package, passing it reassuringly into the ultimate recipient.<br /><br />Lime juice freshly squeezed upon the tofu deposited there, as ablution, meets fragrant sprigs of fresh green cilantro mated with whole <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JMFCRU"">Corriander Seeds 7oz</a>, and a generous ladling of the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GZU7QQ"">Eden Organic Garbanzo Beans, 15-Ounce Unit (Pack of 12)</a> also available upon this generously nutrient amazon. This is a meal in itself, and comes most welcome at noon.<br /><br />At night rather than such a cold lunch, in this cold winter a warmer meal is wanted, and so this gentle and yielding box of nutritious tofu might discover herself pushed gently into a saucepan of simmering miso soup, such as, perhaps, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001RMB4WI"">Shiro Miso Paste NON GMO No MSG Added</a>. This miso soup would take far greater space to describe here in the making. From this container of miso paste draw forth a goodly spoonful to introduce slowly, most politely, into a gently heating small saucepan of water. Later, in place of seaweed and to deceive my own palate, I place those small flat spinach leaves available in the organic department of your local market, perhaps with the results of a small onion diced very carefully in the manner approved as described above, or green onion.<br /><br />When quite ready for dinner, I add last of all to this essence this gentle box of tofu, sliced as described above, with great and tender care, leaving it bathing one might dare say, only long enough to warm through and through, before eating.<br /><br />A veritable meal in itself.<br /><br />There are so many other manners in which to use, and to abuse, this pure, white and utterly nutritious gentle product, and I can only with my utmost recommendation say, and this with my greatest gratitude, that here at long last we may know a food most willingly fit for our human consumption, and one most readily available upon this wonderful amazon."

Another plus is that this mix works just as well with substitutions (I use canola oil instead of butter).  I even baked one batch using applesauce and yogurt instead of oil (moist, fat, brownies were the result).  I like that I can ""de-fat"" them if I want to do so!  I've tried almost every GF brownie mix on the planet and this one is the BEST!  One strange recommendation in the directions is that you freeze the brownies for an hour for best results.

To remove the dead gopher from the trap, push down on the upper frame arm to release the trap jaws and shake the trap and the gopher should fall out.

They have a lighter flavour than the all-beef hotdogs I am used to....and are NOT as unduly salty!  The delicious smoked taste is there, all right -- but it is NOT overpowering, and will NOT burn your tongue!  Just a nice, subtle flavour.  And this all means not only are they delicious, but also that you won't go looking for gallons of water, (or soda, or whatever), after you eat a few.<br /><br />These are BIG, substantial hot-dogs.  If you want yours in a hot-dog bun, it will probably not only fill the bun, but some of the hot-dog will stick out at either end!<br /><br />If you wnat to take the ""wrapping"" (skin), off the hot dog, this is NOT easily done -- but then, it's not easily done with any of the OTHER hot dogs I've ever tried, either.  BUT -- it is EASIER to take off at least PART of the plastic wrapping -- and JUST the plastic wrapping, leaving the hot-dog itself, totally intact -- with thes Sahlen's Smokehouse Hotdogs, than it has EVER been my experience with any other hot-dogs.  (Maybe if I had more patience, I would indeed have been able to take more of -- or even all of -- the plastic wrap off.  But these hot-dogs are SO yummy, such will, I fear, never be the case!)<br /><br />These hot-dogs are conveniently wrapped two together -- so you will NOT be taking the entire contents out, when you want just one, or two.  At least, you won't do this inadvertently.  But -- once tasting these delightful hot-dogs, you may be sorely tempted to do this deliberately....<br /><br />................>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>...................<br /><br />On one of Oprah Winfrey's earliest programs, she and some guests went to a very<br />elite restaurant -- SPAGOS.

Sahlen's has been making, (and probably, perfecting), hot-dogs, since 1869, (140 years).

The females shed twice a year, in my case it was 12 months a year, it was awful to the point of me almost going insane. I loved and hated my beautiful dog! I researched the internet and asked anyone I could if there was a solution to Sammie's problem. I even tried other brands which she wouldn't eat, this became costly.<br />Finally a Petco representative turned me on to Wellness Senior blend. It is as special blend minus fillers , etc., it had vitamins, plus G. Condrodin (sp) for her hip problems.<br />I gradually adjusted her diet over a period of a couple weeks Wellness is a very rich dog food, dogs need to adjust to the new food. She loved the taste, after a short period of time her shedding almost came to a stop along with her dandruff.  After her passing I found out Groenendaels need to be brushed daily or at least several times a week, if you do this regularly they do not need bathing. That is what the experts say. The breed is really Very Special, a great family dog check them out.<br />There is no way you can go wrong with Wellness dog foods, be sure to go to their web site to check out their science, be sure to read the customer testimonials.

You pop it in your mouth, and the sensation is similar to chewing on beef jerky, only much better.  The flavor starts to come through very quickly - creamy and aromatic.<br /><br />It's certainly the easiest way to get the full mango flavor experience without the mess.  The quality is consistent - you don't get the odd funny-tasting piece like you do with other dried fruits.<br /><br />This is a terrific snack.  The chewiness makes each bite last, and the flavor just keeps coming.  You can easily make a single serving size last 5 minutes, and there aren't many snack foods that can match that!"

And it's great for those of us with acidic stomachs who are not supposed to have black tea or mint (there is a little mint in this, but only enough to give you a hint of the flavor). And the licorice is mild enough not to taste very much like licorice and just makes it sweet enough not to need sugar. Perfect in every way."

The bite-sized crunch is lightly sweet and delicious.  I was instantly hooked and got online to do a lot of research because I had a serious doubt about food products made in China. I really hoped this product would have a clean bill of health so I would feel comfortable buying it regularly.<br /><br />I should say that Mrs. May's website erased a big part of my concerns. First of all, most ingredients were grown in US and Canada. Only three ingredients are sourced from China (rice malt, sesame seeds, and sea salt).  This is important because chemical contamination of China's natural resources is so serious that I won't want to eat a lot of food products grown there without endorsement from very reliable inspection agencies. The company seems to have done a lot of work to make sure the manufacturing process would be safe from microbiological hazard as well.  They also use two 3rd party international inspection agencies.  That being said, I've learned from multiple sources that Chinese factories are known for staging for health inspections. So I cannot just rely on the company's own words.  However, what makes me more convinced is that Whole Foods is one of their buyers.  I think this is an important endorsement for the product.  It makes me feel a lot more comfortable about making the purchase myself.  With the overall food safety concerns removed, I will give this product 4.5 stars.<br /><br />A good reference is Mrs. May's website FAQ on general production.  Since Amazon does not allow pasting of the link here, you can just google the website and check it out."

Our pooches were just as happy to eat Newman's Own Lamb and Barley Dog Treats as they do their regular organic treats. Taste wise, they seem to rate 5 stars.<br /><br />Take note that these treats are hard. If your pooch is a gulper, you might need to break it into pieces. Our dogs are all chewers and took their time right down to licking the floor to get the crumbs.<br /><br />Price wise, these treats cost slightly more than the organic brands I usually buy. It appears Amazon will eventually provide these through the ""Subscribe and Save"" program. If / when that happens, the 15% discount will bring these down in price. Until then, I'm knocking off one star for price.<br /><br />If you question whether, in general, it's worth paying a premium price for organic foods and treats, read on.<br /><br />Treat prices and ingredient quality vary wildly. Higher quality almost always equals higher price. Products certified ""organic"" usually add yet another premium.<br /><br />Whether or not you buy organic pretty much depends on whether or not you've given thought to what your dog is eating. In our case, we admitedly gave it little thought. At the super market we always bought name brand foods and treats and figured that doing so made us good gaurdians.<br /><br />Oliver, our 8 year old dachsund, suffered loose stools and had trouble keeping down food for years. After a really bad case of him having the runs, it was recommended that we try changing his diet to certified organic products containing no wheat or corn.<br /><br />We learned that grains used in most super market dog food and treats are often a mixture of wheat and corn said to cause allergies that can cause stomach problems.<br /><br />Additionally, products not certified organic are allowed to be inconsistent. Between batches, the amount of meat by-products can vary wildly.  By-products include lungs, spleen, kidneys, brain, liver, blood, bone, and stomach and intestines.<br /><br />Also, non-organic pet food can be leagally made from meat sources rejected for human consumption. Shockingly, even brand name pet food manufacturors are often a legal dumping ground for dead, dying, disabled and deseased animals.<br /><br />Making the change to all organic food and treats made a difference with Olliver in just a few days. It's been years now since I've had to clean up one of his messes.<br /><br />Olliver's canine housemates had no qualms eating the lower grade food. While they don't seem to care we made the choice to feed them better, we sure feel better knowing what it is they're really eating."

I baked 1/3 of the batter on glass, 1/3 on corningware, and 1/3 on baking sheet.  The glass batch turned out best.  The corningware batch flattened a little more than the glass batch and also was more crumbling.  The baking sheet ones tasted burnt although they didn't look burnt; the baking sheet ones looked similar to the glass batch but tasted burnt and I threw them out.  I don't know of any other gluten-free chocolate chip cookie mix that is also potato free and this one tastes great.  Reminds me of the duncan hines regular glutened-mix but not as good as the recipe on the back of Tollhouse cookies glutened cookies.<br /><br />Another very similar mix I like a little better is Authentic Foods Chocolate Chunk Cookie Mix which AF just came out with and since Amazon carries AF, hopefully they will carry the Chocolate Chunk Cookie Mix soon.  The ingredients for them is:  Rice Flour, Organic Granulated Can Juice, Dark Chocolate Chunks (granulated can juice, chocolate liquor, cocoa butter, dextrose, soy lecithin, vanilla), Natural vanilla flavor, salt, baking soda, soy lechitin - Gluten-free Wheat-free May contain milk & soy  To mix add 2 eggs, 3 oz veg oil and 1 oz water.  Bake 10-15min at 375.  The Authentic Foods Chocolate Chunk Cookie holds together a little better than Pamela's.  The AF cookie has a more buttery taste whereas Pamela's has a more cocoa taste to the cookie.

Yet Another Saffron Review,"If you purchase saffron then chances are you have encountered at least one of my other saffron reviews. I've tried most of it from Amazon after finding it exceptionally difficult to purchase decent saffron in my small town. Unfortunately, nothing replaces the truly exceptional delight that is pure saffron so my search for superior saffron continues.<br /><br />There we no other reviews on this and I was a bit hesitant to purchase an entire 1 ounce tin especially from the Roland brand name which is often associated with imports from China. The description did not even indicate if this saffron was from Spain or not but the price was ultra-right (also somewhat suspect since it was such a good price).<br /><br />First, set your mind at ease...this saffron is indeed from Spain rather than the often inferior products from elsewhere. It comes sealed in a plastic bag inside a decorative tin but even at that, the aroma was clearly evident before opening the shipping box.<br /><br />As for the quality of the saffron. It's good but not great. To test, I make a standard dish and compare the quantity required to bring it to the right level of taste...it required more than that of the Frontier brand of Saffron (very fresh but the selection of packaging requires it to ""air out"" due to lingering odor from plastic liner) but not nearly as much as some of the other dried little sad saffron selections I've encountered in local grocery stores or even via ordering here online.<br /><br />The actual touch/texture also denotes a fair level of freshness rather than the dry stubble of inferior brands but wasn't quite as supple as I'd normally desire.<br /><br />Fragrance - very nice and aromatic.<br /><br />Overall - for the price, I'm very pleased. It will not be my first choice on the finest dishes BUT it does provide a very solid option for general use with a price that won't make me cringe.<br /><br />On a side note, Amazon and/or the Roland brand ran a special promotion for an additional percentage off all Roland products...combined with the subscribe and save option this was the best price per ounce I've EVER encountered for true Spanish saffron. Keep an eye out for guilt free, affordable saffron you can use in any dish rather than having to save for special dishes only."

I have not tried all the other brands, so I am only comparing this to coconut water ordered at restaurants (which I think is usually sweetened, so it really isn't a fair comparison), Vitacoco, and Amy and Brian's. Vitacoco uses Brazilian coconuts while Taste Nirvana and Amy and Brian's use Thai coconuts. It seems like Taste Nirvana and Amy and Brian's are naturally sweeter than Vitacoco, with Taste Nirvana being the sweetest. This is a good sweet though, since all of these three brands have no sugars added. While I've liked all the coconut water I've tasted, Vitacoco can have a slightly more salty and less sweet taste, while Taste Nirvana has an amazing taste with just the right amount of sweetness. I liked the pulp as well, although some of the pieces seem to be from more mature coconuts rather than the young almost gelatin pulps I'm used to at some restaurants.<br /><br />The only reason I took a star off is due to the price. These 9.5 oz bottles are not the most economical way to buy Taste Nirvana. In fact, at the current price this costs as much as I paid at the coffee shop for individual bottles. For the best bargain on this brand, buy <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004OW342G"">Taste Nirvana Real Coconut Water With Pulp, 16.2-Ounce (Pack of 12)</a>.<br /><br />I wanted to try this brand because a lot of people say Taste Nirvana or Amy and Brian's taste the best, and I'd have to give my vote to Taste Nirvana. Hopefully some day I will taste a fresh coconut and maybe that will get my vote, but if you're like me and don't have any coconut trees nearby, try this out. Enjoy!"

I plan on buying the larger trays as well for greater farming capacity. Also more hemp bags. I also plan on trying the nut milk bags for sprouting. My only complaint on the hemp ones is they smell a little musty, like wet rope. I am going to try a little H2O2 on them to see if that lowers the smell.

Success!,"These are hard dog biscuit treats (like MilkBones) in a square shape about 1.5"" on each side and 1/4"" thick.  So for a small dog, they're pretty big. I tried to break it up for my little dog, but it was hard as a rock and I wasn't about to try and hack it with a knife so I just gave it to her as-is. This is the only reason I'm deducting a star because the ingredients are great and they are good treats but sometimes a full sized treat is too much for a small dog.<br /><br />We have a 4 year old, 9lb mutt who is REALLY picky and not very food motivated.  She has been known to turn her nose up at fish if not prepared to her liking and has literally spit out most grocery store purchased dog treats - especially if they require any effort to actually crunch them to eat. It's like she can't remember that she has the capacity to eat hard foods, so she'll let a bowl of her (very expensive) dog food sit out for 24 hours before remembering how her jaw works.<br /><br />So. Needless to say I was surprised when she took this treat from my hands and ran off to another room with it.  In the other room, she sat and inspected it and played with it for about a minute before she was struck with the idea to try and eat it. Normally this is when she leaves the treat in the middle of the room and comes back to me to see if I'm going to give her the real treat - usually some kind of jerky - but to my surprise, she ate the whole thing.  And when she was done she ran back to where we were and sat in front of the bag.  Waiting.  This has never happened with a dry treat before so I have to assume that's a sign of approval from a pleased dog.  I gave her a second one, which she hid under her blanket for about 3 minutes before coming back to it to eat.<br /><br />In Amazon's 6 pack it breaks down to about $3.25 for each package.  Compared to the biscuit treats I had tried before with similar ingredients that my dog rejected, this is on par with the pricing.  It's more expensive than treats I'd find in normal grocery store aisles or at the big pet store chains, but about the same price as the stuff I normally get at specialty pet stores.  It's way cheaper than the duck jerky I had been buying, but those are two totally different types of treats so I can't compare the two and this will not replace my dog's duck treats.  The biggest selling point for me is that I have to go to a specialty pet store to find the other biscuit treats with the same kind of ingredients so being able to order this in bulk on Amazon makes it a much sweeter deal."

I think there might just be too much corn for the amount of oil. And definitely doesn't have the movie theater taste or texture. Also, if you put all the seasoning salt in with the corn & oil, a lot of it sticks to the machine, so I leave a little to sprinkle on afterwards to help with the flavor. I'm thinking maybe I'll try not using all the corn, next time and see if that is a better corn-to-oil ratio. I might also try just using a big pot too and see if that's any better than the Stir Crazy.<br /><br />** EDIT ** July 2011 ** so, after popping quite a few bags in different ways, I can say now that if you use a regular kettle, with only 1/2 the salt, it tastes great. I think it's because only about 2/3 of it pops - so this allows for more oil/flavor per kernel."

I wasn't sure what to expect, but so far, I've been pleased. I tore the plastic open, put the frozen potato on a baking sheet in the oven and put it on 350. 45 minutes later it was done and turned out being delicious. The cheese filling was crispy on-top and the potato itself underneath was nice and soft. No way would they come out as good if put in the microwave, so I'd say oven cooking these is definitely the way to go. Now, you can obviously make your own stuffed baked potatoes for far cheaper then what Omaha charges for these alone, but as long as you get a good deal on the Omaha website, these simply make a great addition to any Omaha steaks order. As delicious are they are though, I wouldn't order a box of JUST these off the site due to the added shipping costs. But like I said, as long as they're part of a nicely priced packaged deal, I'll definitely take them. Actually, I probably wouldn't order any packaged deal in the future from Omaha that didn't include these. A big plus, at least for me, is if you check the ingredients list on these, there's no partially hydrogenated oils, so there's no traces of trans fats, which is very rare with stuffed baked potatoes. Also no high fructose corn syrup, which is another rarity on a food product like this and is always a plus. If you make your own or buy them frozen from your grocery store for example, chances are, the butter used, sour cream, etc. will be full of chemicals, trans fats & high fructose corn syrup. These, not so much. So there is a definite degree of quality with Omahas stuffed baked potatoes. Each potato does have 8 grams of saturated fat, which is 42% the DRV, but that's obviously to be expected with anything that contains bacon, cheese and sour cream. I was also expecting there to be no fiber, but it turns out there's 3grams of fiber per baked potato half. Another plus.

I am puzzled how they can be sold and shipped since the front of the bag states ""perishable - keep refrigerated"".  I opened the bag and smelled the noodles, and they did have a rather strange, strong odor.  I immediate poured the noodles into a strainer and then rinsed them under cold water.  I put them in a sauce pan with a small amount of Lorivo expeller-pressed peanut oil and let them sit for a while, stirring occasionally.  I decided to add Guilin chili sauce, garlic powder, powdered ginger, a small amount rice vinegar, water, 3 - 4 tsp. coconut sap sugar and 1/2 large can drained bean sprouts.  I warmed this mixture for awhile - maybe 20 or more minutes.  It worked!  I created a palatable side dish with a good- tasting broth and appealing consistency.<br /><br />I served this side dish with broiled tuna, mahi mahi, and a Spring greens salad mix with balsamic vinegar and olive oil.<br />I wish that these noodles were available in larger sized bags at a lower price per serving, but $1 per person for two modest serving sizes per bag isn't outrageous unless you compare this with the cost of regular pasta.  I added the bean sprouts because the noodles alone didn't look like enough food for 3 people, and I thought that adding bean sprouts would offset any texture issues with the noodles. This recipe has now worked out twice with no real concern about cooking time for the noodles. Maybe the vinegar is the key, but the noodles are just like any other noodles when prepared this way and they make a great noodles with Asian-style broth meal or side dish.  And finally ... a use for those canned bean sprouts!<br /><br />Update:  I have now mixed these with baked tofu and Asian-style sauce. That combo worked out great.  Also I took the wide noodles, rinsed them and then put them in spaghetti sauce to simmer.  They tasted fine. Texture-wise, they will always be somewhat slimy and slippery and not al dente like well-prepared pasta, but otherwise, they worked out well. Just remember - just 40 calories - in an entire bag!

I've used this brand of canned pumpkin before, so it was not new to me. I find the flavor to be a little more like a fresh pumpkin and the texture to be a little less creamy than mass market brands. But not to a degree where it causes problems in any of the recipes I use it in. The cost per can of ordering here on Amazon is less than what the local natural food store I usually buy it at sells it for. And since they were very low on stock last time I bought it and had no expected restocking date, I figured the savings and availibility made it worth the risk of ordering online even after reading the reviews.<br /><br />Which leads me to the packaging. Yes, as many other reviewers have reported, cans were dented. The outside packaging along with the other items in my order were in perfect condition, it was not until I got to the ""ready to ship"" flat of cans that were pre-packaged by the manufacturer that I found any damage whatsoever. 8 of the 12 cans had dents. However, they are only small dents and don't affect the safety or quality of the product in any way. I wouldn't have hesitated to purchase the cans off of a store shelf in this condition since the product is in very short supply, so it isn't a problem for me."

It's an unusual tea, slightly sweet (it contains stevia) and very carob-y. The good news is that it does not have any of the usual kava taste or smell that many people find offensive. The bad news is that I can't feel any of the anxiety relief effects of the tea, although it does say that there are 78mg of kava root extract in the tea. Still, it's a lovely cup of tea, and relaxing because it just tastes good. I can also taste the spiciness of the tea, which is very pleasant. I usually brew two bags in one cup, which is recommended on the package for a stronger and more relaxing effect; however, I even tried four bags once, but still didn't notice a relaxing effect. I am familiar with kava and the overall effect of kava is pretty subtle anyway, so this is something to be aware of. Your experience of the tea may be different.<br /><br />Kava Stress Relief Tea comes with an expiration date (a good thing, because it's not full of preservatives, plus you can tell if it is fresh) and has many organic ingredients.<br /><br />The ingredients in Kava Stress Relief Tea are: kava root extract, carob pod, Indian sarsaparilla root, organic cinnamon bark, organic ginger root, organic cardamom seed, stevia leaf, barley malt, natural hazelnut flavor, natural cinnamon flavor, and natural licorice flavor. Amazingly, I can taste many of these in this lovely and complex cup of tea. I would rate the taste five stars for flavor and uniqueness.<br /><br />Yogi Tea seems to be another company (like Numi, Aspen, Traditional Medicinals) that values sustainable and healthy practices. Their web site has a helpful glossary of tea ingredients and is beautifully designed, with info about each tea they make. Their tea bag tags have metaphysical sayings on them like, ""Your breath is the voice of your soul"" and ""Your head must bow to your heart"".<br /><br />Yogi Tea writes this on the box about the tea's benefits: ""Kava Stress Relief tea helps you calm down as it relieves stress, anxiety and minor pain, as well as lending gentle support to the digestion and the kidneys. A member of the peppercorn family, Kava (Piper methysticum) is a highly prized medicinal and beverage plant, whose primary benefit is alleviating anxiety. ""Kava-kava,"" native to Oceania and the South Pacific Islands, has been used and cultivated for its ability to calm the body and mind, and encourage a good night's sleep. A powerful antispasmodic, this herb promotes a state of ""relaxed unconcern"" while compromising neither mental functions nor clarity of thought when used appropriately. Furthermore, Kava has been shown to relax the uterus and relieve menstrual cramps and minor menopausal symptoms.* The Herb Research Foundation (2000) indicates that scientific data supports the use of kava for minor anxiety, stress, restlessness, muscle tension and mild pain. For added flavor, our formula has been complemented with Stevia, Sarsaparilla and Organic Carob. Enjoy a warm soothing cup of Kava Stress Relief, a delicious way to relax.""<br /><br />In addition to the standard disclaimer that the tea is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease, there is a warning on the box, ""Ask a healthcare professional before use if you have or have had liver problems, frequently use alcoholic beverages, or are taking any medication. Stop use and see a doctor if you develop symptoms that may signal liver problems (e.g., unexplained fatigue, abdominal pain, loss of appetite, fever, vomiting, dark urine, pale stools, yellow eyes or skin). Not for use by persons under 18 years of age, or by pregnant or breastfeeding women. Not for use with alcoholic beverages. Excessive use, or use with products that cause drowsiness, may impair your ability to operate a vehicle or heavy equipment.""<br /><br />Note that the media scare about kava several years ago was not for the kava root, and it is my opinion that based on my own research that kava is very safe. However, I am not a physician, and if you have any health concerns, you should check with an appropriate professional.<br /><br />I decided to give Kava Stress Relief Tea four stars since it didn't really work for me. Still, it is a wonderful and recommended tea, and may work for you!<br /><br />****"

To briefly address these: There has been no evidence that Mrs. Mays keeps its workers in sweatshops; despite the Communism, I'm sure the individual citizens find these jobs valuable; and ships produce 1/10th the carbon per pound-mile of trucks, meaning a 5000 miles by ship is as bad as 500 miles by truck.<br /><br />I really like the snack and I'd give it five stars, but I'm subtracting one star: I think it is deceptive that it was so hard to find out the snack was made in China. I don't have a problem with the snack's origin, but Mrs. Mays should be more forthright with their customers and let them make the decision themselves. Granted, most of us Americans are primed to flip out at the latest Scare of the Week, but that should be our choice to make.<br /><br />Oh, and the snack itself? It is quite tasty, filling, and healthy. I will continue to purchase it."

I don't end up with a lot of ""tea dust"" at the bottom of my cup. This ""tea dust"" does increase as you use the tea and get farther down in the tin (I assume this is because the smaller pieces naturally tend to settle toward the bottom of the packaging in shipment).<br /><br />Overall, a nice blend!

This is my first bonsai, and I can already tell you it isnt a houseplant or even an outdoor plant. Its a lot close to a pet. You need to check in on it at least once a day.

Also, it likes direct sunlight in the morning hours, but not during midday. I keep mine where it receives direct sunlight until about 1130am.

Licorice in tea is one of my favorite things of all time, and the Licorice Mint tea from Red Leaf Tea is a must for me when I'm sick. And while I love allsorts, any other licorice candy is not for me. I just think it's vile. Every Easter my mother would gleefully sit by as I sorted out all of the black jelly beans from my basket. She was the only one in the family who liked them. Is there anything more gross than popping what you think is a purple jellybean into your mouth, only to discover it was a horrible, horrible, licorice one? Blegh! But allsorts....mmm. They've become a bit of tradition in our family. They're impossible to find in Tennessee, so when I'm sending a package to my folks I always include Coffee Crisp for my mom and allsorts for my dad. That is, if I can keep myself from eating them all before the package goes out! Trust me, it happens more often than I care to admit.<br /><br />I kept eyeing this tea, adding it to my shopping cart and then removing it in favor of another flavor of matcha, adding it back to my wishlist. I finally bit the bullet and I'm here to find out if this is an allsort or a black jellybean.<br /><br />It's not a black jellybean at all! It is a lovely sweet licorice that soothes the throat and makes me unbelievably happy. I was very scared of this blend, but those fears were unfounded. It is delicious and definitely one I need to keep around for when I'm sick but I have to deal with work anyway. Completely lovely. It's not really an allsort either, it's the licorice I've come to know and love in teas. I should have expected that, but I was scared by the picture on the website.<br /><br />Licorice tends to polarize people. You either love it or you hate it. I'm one of those who loves it, but my wife is one who hates it. If it's in a tea, she can taste it, and it bothers her. But for me...oh, I love it and this matcha is beautiful in the balance of flavor to matcha. I want to make a large mug of this, but I have other matchas to taste and review!"

I was concerned when I read the reviews on here and someone said the bars were stale/ old/ not fresh, so I was prepared to send them back if need be.

The first thing upon opening up the resealable package is that the treats are a little on the large size and seem to be meant to break in half as there is a line down the middle that allows you to snap in two.  These should not be considered training treats because they are much too big to feed to your dog several times a day.  I did smell them before giving them to the dogs and the smell seemed fresh and reminded me of a regular cookie which is what they resemble.<br /><br />Now for taste I left that to the dogs.  I have two dogs a Schipperkie and a Mini Aussie that are given treats twice a day plus training treats.  They only eat the finest products which are fresh from the dog bakery or a gourment dog treat store so it is safe to say the dogs are somewhat pickey.  When I first gave the treats they both took them from me and ran off to enjoy. Now it is important to note that when they get a really special treat they each go to there favorite place to enjoy and keep the other dog from stealing the treat.  In this case the dogs ate their treats next to each other so I am going to assume they did not feel that the treat was all that special.  Next I put the Newman Treat in the bowl with a cookie that smells like a pizza from the dog bakery.  One dog took the Newman cookie first and the other dog took the pizza cookie first which was smaller than the Newman treat.  The dogs digested the food properly after checking as the poop size was normal after a week of using the Newman product as their daily treats.<br /><br />All in all I wish the product was sold in a smaller size but the quality of the treat seemed to be good and the dogs liked the treats but I dont feel they loved them (as I mentioned before they did not go to their special place to eat the treats in piece and quite as they will do on their favorite treats).

It is 100% nutritionally complete, with no grain fillers.  When you pop the top on the single-serve can, it looks and smells like exactly what it is -- fish and shrimp.  Obviously, the fish smells like fish, but it's a natural, clean fish smell, not a nasty cat-food odor.  I swear, the steamed tuna and shrimp, with its whole shrimp, looked good enough to set out with crackers for a human appetizer!<br /><br />Although I would feed this food to my cats without hesitation, I felt I had to downgrade it one star because of the cats' opinions.  I fed this to three family cats, and being cats, each had its own opinion, but none endorsed it 100%.  One cat loved the steamed tuna and shrimp, one wouldn't go near it.  One gobbled up the yellowfin tuna, two picked at and left most of it.  My son's cat is notoriously fussy about canned food, and ate only one of these entrees with enthusiasm; my two cats are notoriously unfussy, but ate only two wholeheartedly (however, they usually prefer poultry flavors to fish).<br /><br />Petite Cuisine comes in handy single-serving cans and, as I mentioned, contains excellent ingredients with no foul odor or appearance.

As for the product itself, I had been using a coconut milk from a carton that was smooth and did not separate. This coconut milk separates into the coconut water and coconut cream, so when the can is opened, the harder coconut cream is on top and the water is underneath. Since I only use 1 serving at a time (1/4 cup) this means dividing the cream and coconut water separately. I tried blending it in a blender but it still did not blend together.

I bring my lunch to work every day sometimes in the guise of ""Campbell's Chunky Grilled Chicken & Sausage Gumbo"" in an 18.6 oz can or 15.25 oz microwave bowl.<br /><br />The soup brand, whose tag line used to be ""so thick you could eat it with a fork, but bring a spoon because you'll want to get every drop,""  is actually quite tasty, much more so than Progresso Soup, which I find (very) bland in comparison.  And Campbell's Chunky Soup is good for you; most of the varieties have vegetables and lean cuts of meat, and are low in fat and contain at least 2 grams of dietary fiber, but Campbell's ""Chunky Grilled Chicken & Sausage Gumbo"" contains a scant 2.5 grams per serving.<br /><br />According to Campbell's its ""Chunky Grilled Chicken & Sausage Gumbo"" is a zesty gumbo loaded with chunks of grilled chicken, sausage and vegetables like celery, red and green peppers plus lots of rice in a savory seasoned broth and has just 140 calories and comfortably low 2.5 grams of fat per serving.  Loaded with generous portions of both chicken, sausage, rice and the other trappings of gumbo this hearty bowl is enough to satisfy me for a few hours and the average cost is only $1.69 per microwave bowl at my local Target Super Store.  How is that for an inexpensive lunch?  However, the taste of this particular variety of Chunk Soup is a little light on flavoring despite the rather generous 850mg of sodium.<br /><br />Nutritional Information<br />Ingredients: Water, Diced Tomatoes in Tomato Juice, Rice, Tomato Puree (Water, Tomato Paste), Cooked White Chicken Meat, Cooked Andouille Sausage (Pork, Water, Seasonings [Spices, Dextrose, Onion Powder, Garlic Powder], Salt, Hickory Char Oil [Partially Hydrogenated Soybean Oil, Natural Woodsmoke Flavor], Sodium Nitrite), Celery, Okra, Green Peppers,<br />Servicing information: One serving (1 Cup) of ""Chunky Grilled Chicken & Sausage Gumbo"" contains 140 Calories, 2.5 grams of fat (including 1 gram of saturated fat), 15mg of Cholesterol, 850mg of Sodium, 21 grams of carbohydrates, 3 grams of dietary fiber, 4 grams of sugar, and 8 grams of protein.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />There is always plenty of Campbell's Chucky Soup in the pantry at my house.  It is by-and-large the only kind I buy and Campbell's ""Chunky Grilled Chicken & Sausage Gumbo"" figures highly on my shopping list each week.  Low in calories and fat, Campbell's ""Chunky Grilled Chicken & Sausage Gumbo"" somewhat bland, but ultimately filling alternative to burger and fries, and even a sandwich and chips.  And most importantly if fills me up until my mid-afternoon snack."

I'm sure if they say it's oolong, then it probably is an oolong, but it really tastes more like a green tea.  It's also very mildly flavored.  I find it benefits from a longer brew time than recommended.  There's certainly no bitterness upon over brewing this tea as there would be with a black tea, and the slight floral flavor and fragrance seems to be enhanced rather than harmed by this.  The flower bloom is durable: I put an unfinished pot in the refrigerator overnight to try it as iced tea, and the flower survived perfectly well without disintegrating.  If anything, the tea benefited from the additional overnight brew.  Served cold, the flavor comes out even more if you're partial to iced tea.<br /><br />The flower arrangement upon brewing is pretty--nowhere near as pretty or as perfect as the pictures that Numi shows on their website, and it's as likely to bloom lopsided as it is to flower right side up.

I mean, I didn't try them myself, so I can't compare their deliciousness (or lack thereof) to the other treats on the market. I can say that my dog seemed to enjoy them, wolfing them down without delay. Then again, she'd probably take down a bottle of hand lotion or a burger wrapper just as quickly.<br /><br />Still, it was good to see her working her gums on these treats, and her breath wasn't too bad afterwards. Another plus is the lack of stains or related mess on the floor once she was done. The seam in the middle is also a nice touch if you want to break them up for smaller dogs or multiple pets."

After rinsing I tossed them into a stir fry pan with various veggies some spices and a bit of soy sauce and except for the slightly tougher texture the dish came out tasting like noodle take out from our local Chinese restaurant.

We have two pedigree Persian cats, and they are as finicky eaters as any cats alive. My wife and I have tried all kinds of different wet and dry foods, but our cats usually just turn up their noses and look at us like we're stupid, until we give them something we know they like. So, when this arrived and I opened the chicken pot pie to see it was full of chunks of chicken and carrot (and something else, potato maybe) in what looked like chicken soup, I braced myself for packing up the remainder and donating it to the local animal shelter...but, NO! Both of our cats dug right in. Both ate up all the soup, and one cleared his bowl. The other left the larger chunks of chicken and all the veggies (he never eats veggies). For our cats, that's a rave review. The second kind, shredded chicken in sesame sauce, they didn't like as much, but they still cleared out all the liquid and a good portion of the chicken. Honestly, I was very pleasantly surprised they ate as much of the new stuff as they did. It must be good. For us, these single serving size cans are perfect, because we can split one between the two cats (they don't eat much), or give half in the morning and half in the evening, so it comes in quantities our pets are comfortable with. Also, packaging two kinds in one box is helpful, as our cats also thrive on variety. Because our cats did not eat it down to the bowl like they would their current favorites, I can't give the product five stars, but I do give this product a hearty four and half stars, and I think we are likely to buy this brand in the future if its price is competitive with our cats' current favorites."

First of all this is NOT what NASA eats as their regular food supply. They do in fact have real fruits and other things like meat products and they do have freeze-dried snacks to reduce the weight on the space shuttle. this food is extremely light weight as compared to traditional foods. On a space shuttle launch every pound costs thousands of dollars so literately every pound counts. I would see this being a good snack pack for the crew of a space shuttle on the bridge or other space craft crew or the I.S.S(International Space Station)teams. But let me explain what exactly you are supposed to get in this sampler. Two 4inchesx4inches freeze dried astronaut ice cream squares one green mint chocolate chip and the other strawberry/vanilla/chocolate combo flavor, and one freeze dried ice cream sandwich. You also should get two astronaut space food energy bars with a refrigerator magnet. One chocolate and the other peanut butter. So basically what they show in the picture is what you get in this food sampler. But if you ask me it did make me thirsty. So I would drink a good amount of water after eating this stuff. Oh and FYI the ice cream is broken up into peaces so you can eat smaller peaces of of it. So my opinion is great sampler for the money. Just have water with yours."

It's the typical variety of beans, split peas and dried vegetables plus a seasoning pack. Very easy to make - bring 7 cups of water to a boil, add the beans, simmer for 2 hours, and add the seasoning pack about 10 minutes before it's done. Good flavor - not spicy, but not bland either. Does not taste salty but, if you're on a sodium-restricted diet, note that the sodium count is pretty high (660mg).<br /><br />It is not, however, what I would call hearty. There's only 6 ounces of beans, so when you add 7 cups of water you're getting a pretty thin soup. But, you can easily dress it up a bit. I use the soup as a base, and add in things such as rice, pasta, diced potatoes, diced ham, shredded chicken, greens (such as swiss chard, spinach or kale), fresh or frozen vegetables, and so on. Not all at once, of course - just toss in whatever is hanging around the fridge or pantry. A dash or two of hot sauce often hits the spot as well. Making it with 50% water and 50% stock (either chicken or turkey) also helps put a bit more hearty into the pot.<br /><br />If you use this as a starter and dress it up, it's well worth getting, especially if you can get it on one of the sharply discounted sale prices.

The texture and flavor are a definite hit with everyone in my family, even my very picky daughter.<br /><br />The sweet potato chips aren't too sweet or too salty and they don't feel greasy at all. They are really crisp. The flavor is a little bland, but it also doesn't have the aftertaste that some vegetable chips can have.<br /><br />The first ingredient listed on the chips is rice flour, not sweet potatoes.<br /><br />I'd like these better if they had more going for them nutritionally. The Terra chips are higher in dietary fiber, vitamin A and C.<br /><br />I plan to try some of the other flavors soon. I think they would be a wonderful topping for casseroles if they stay crispy enough."

It's a nice cup of coffee, and even if you don't care for dark roast, you may find you like this one.<br /><br />I drink my coffee black, and this is a great coffee to do so.

That's one thing to like about Quaker Instant Oatmeal. This particular brand -- Maple & Brown Sugar -- also claims ""whole grains"" oats, no trans fats, and no high fructose corn syrup.<br /><br />That's all good. It also tastes good, heats quickly, and has good consistency whether one uses milk or water.<br /><br />Yet it's not perfect. It's not as healthful as pure oats (of whatever brand), by which I mean no ingredients other than oats.<br /><br />This one contains various ""artificial flavors"" and chemicals. That includes caramel color. I heard a radio report claiming that some people now believe that caramel color may cause some cancers.<br /><br />So check whatever you buy for caramel color. Lots of bread and cereal products contain it. In this case, I suppose the caramel color is to help create the ""brown sugar"" look for this product.<br /><br />The ingredients actually list ""sugar,"" but not ""brown sugar."" Maybe it's all the same, but loses its brown color under certain conditions, hence, the use of caramel color.<br /><br />This is still a mostly healthful, and tasty product. But look for oats with nothing other than oats if you want the oats' maximum health benefits.<br /><br />If you still prefer buying one of Quaker's ""flavored"" instant oatmeals, I suggest one of the Cinnamon flavored ones.

Yes, it is no doubt cheaper to go some other route, that's why 4 instead of 5 stars.<br /><br />But the taste is what you want to know about, right?  The Dark Chocolate flavor is fairly robust with little 'grittyness' to it.  Plop a marshmallow in the cup before brewing and you'll have a real treat!  It comes out strong enough on either the 6 oz or 10 oz setting of the brewer.  Not surprisingly, the milk chocolate flavor is not as strong and a little smoother.  Marshmallow trick has a little different effect making the milk chocolate not only creamier and smoother but a little dilute too.  So, maybe a few mini-marshmallows instead of a full-sized one for this flavor.  Oh, and definitely go 6 oz cup.  My oldest granddaughter and I contest for the peppermint chocolate.  She wins, of course, but it's pretty good when I can get one.  No marshmallow needed.

I confirmed this with customer service.  Leaving the remaining review as it was...<br /><br />*********************<br /><br />My wife had made her own baby food for our daughter for the first eight months.  Then, when our daughter was going to begin daycare, there was a certain convenience factor of being about to send in jars of baby food for her and so we bought Earth's Best.  It was organic, and figured to be the closest bought brand to what she had been making herself.  The variety packs are a nice, easy way to stock different kinds for our baby to enjoy...  and enjoy she did for several of the flavors, though some she hated as well.  All in all, we were pleased, and baby seemed pleased.<br /><br />Needless to say, I was pretty surprised to read the review about BPA in the lids.  I spent some time trying to verify this myself.  A lot of different blogs stated it, and while I couldn't find anything definitive, here's what bothered me:  Clearly Earth's Best knows people are concerned about BPA in their lids...  their own facebook site is littered with people asking this same question.  The admin answers these the same way... food safety and baby health is of the highest priority, call us to discuss.  That's only slightly paraphrased.  Going to their website, they have zero articles on BPA and none in the FAQs section either...  nothing.  I'm not worried enough about the issue to stop using what we purchased, but I would have felt a whole lot better about the company and their products if they would acknowledge parents' concerns and tell parents...  something.  Hey, we check our food in laboratory testing regularly and the the amount of BPA found in our food is X, which is so low, there are no health concerns...  just say something...  anything.  Do you really want the onus on the customer to contact you to keep using your product?<br /><br />As I was taking the time to review their product, I decided I would call them to give them a fair chance to explain.  Something, I likely wouldn't have done if I wasn't writing a review.  Their office was closed...  9AM - 7PM est.  Not the most convenient times for a working parent, but I will attempt to follow up and update this accordingly.<br /><br />***UPDATED (old)****<br />Just spoke to someone from customer service.  She says that the liner that comes into contact with the food is BPA free, but that there is another section of the lid behind this liner, that does contain BPA, but that section of the lid does not come in contact with the food.  I'm sure not everyone will be okay with that answer, but I'm ok with it.  I still think it should be an answer that's readily available to consumers without calling them, but I will say there was no hold time at least."

Are we worthy?","Newman's Own Organic Dark Chocolate Bar is good if you like semi-dark and mildly sweet chocolate that is a little harder with a slightly higher melting point than that of European chocolate of similar expectations. I liked the chocolate very much but I did not find it to have any superior qualities to Hershey's chocolate. The product is sold in a pack of 12 bars but my sample from the ""Vine"" program consisted of only one bar. I am not sure if my opinions would have changed given a larger sample, but my confidence and enjoyment of the review would have been significantly greater by having a larger sample from which to provide a better comparison of quality and quantity with competitive products. I am certain that the people running the Vine Program at Amazon fully understand the importance of having a reasonable sample in quantity and that such quantity that reached the reviewers may have been less than what was originally planned to be a sample of sufficient size. In other words, ""Who ate the chocolate?"" is a question that should be investigated by an independent party and that those with chocolate remnants on their fingers and lips should no longer be allowed to participate in management of the Vine Program.<br /><br />In summary, Newman's chocolate is good, but in my opinion nothing special that could justify the cost. But, the Newman products are supposed to be of higher quality with the excess margin being used to support worthwhile causes and I have no problem with a product such as chocolate where an inflated price provides excess margins to do some good that might otherwise may not have not been done."

I really liked it but I don't think the rest of my family would.  The others would have put a couple of spoons of sugar and a big squeeze of lemon in it. (they like ginger-flavored hot lemonade.)<br />The flavor is much the same as slicing a couple of quarter sized slices of ginger into a cup, adding hot water, and mashing it a bit.  Then add one of those tiny scoops of stevia, or a few drops of stevia extract.<br />This product is a nice alternative for when you don't room in your pocket for ginger root and a knife. Honestly I will probably buy some for sick days.  I lived in Cambodia and the grocery shelves were always stocked with at least 6 brands of ginger drink so I do have an appropriate background to judge.  This product is at least equal to the best of them.<br /><br />Unfortunately it was not a very satisfactory trial. We were sent only one packet from the box, so there was no listing of ingredients or nutritional information.  So I can't say how many carbs and how much sugar is included.  Yes, honey is nice but honey is made of sugar, sugar, and sugar.  Many of us really need to know how much.<br /><br /> I also have to vent, and this is probably not the company that produced it, but an Amazon employee - the single packet, the size of a tea bag, was sent in a 12x18x6 inch cardboard box with six yards of bubble wrap.

The most important qualities of almonds, for me, are freshness, quality, and careful roasting. Blue Diamond almonds get 5 stars on all those parameters.<br /><br />And I've tried all their flavors, especially their ""BOLD"" line. Alas, their definition of ""BOLD"" is apparently ""a little too spicy for kids."" This flavor is okay, as a change of pace, but doesn't exactly set my taste buds a-""blazin'."" It doesn't taste like Buffalo wings -- it's too sweet and not vinegary enough. And it's definitely not spicy enough. I realize that real Buffalo wing spice can be brutal, and might not suit a mass-market snacking product. But really, they haven't even tried here. There's not even a hint of Tabasco, for example.<br /><br />As I said, this is a pleasant enough flavor, especially if you need a little change from, say, my favorite, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ4QJK"">Jalapeno Smokehouse</a>.

(and this is important because one does tend to follow recipes to a fault) you must use half as much as the recipe calls for, which btw, does not work as well as you'd hope.  It's just not nearly as sweet cup for cup.<br /><br />I make that up using extra Splenda white because I use brown sugar for it's sweetness as well as the molasses flavor.  This is why I will only give it four stars....because they COULD make it cup for cup by doing what I do and adding more Splenda white so a baker could follow their recipe and not give it a second thought.  Heaven knows they're charging enough for it.<br /><br />I'm sure you know this:  Brown sugar is unrefined or molasses sugar.  You can make your own brown sugar by adding 1 tablespoon unsulfured molasses to 1 cup cane sugar and mixing it with a fork. It comes out nice and fluffy and you can control how much caramel flavor it has.  (and how much extra sugar too)<br /><br />Splenda brown sugar blend as it is, is a very coarsely granulated Splenda, a little coarser than Splenda white.  So the texture is better than what you might mix up on your own.  So for convenience, you can't beat Splenda brown sugar blend.  The Splenda brand is superior (in my opinion) to the store brands that are popping up but YMMV, and your store might have a really good version.<br /><br />Still...and this accounts for a very good four stars you can always count on Splenda, for texture, for flavor and consistency.  When you bake, that counts for a lot in my book."

I buy them because they're cheap and convenient. I don't buy them in the expectation of great pasta dishes although it's always nice if one of these products is better than my expectations. The overstuffed Italian sausage ravioli was one that was better than my expectations. Currently, this is my ranking for the products I have actually sampled:<br /><br />1. Overstuffed Italian sausage ravioli<br />2. Jumbo spaghetti and meatballs<br />3. Overstuffed beef ravioli<br />4. Beefaroni with whole grain pasta<br /><br />This product distinguishes itself from things like the Beefaroni by having real identifiable neat. It is better than the beef ravioli because the sausage is actually flavorful and tasty whereas the beef ravioli is bland. it is roughly on a par with the spaghetti except that I like the texture and taste better than the spaghetti (but my girlfriend prefers the spaghetti, which she gobbles up in no time).<br /><br />This ravioli is about as good as we're going to get in a can. Canning pasta faces one major chalkenge: it tastes like pasta stored in a can. Chef Boyardee hasn't found a way around this, and I'm not sure there is one.<br /><br />If you buy this product, be aware that each can has two servings, and each serving has plenty of sodium. Eating one full can will leave little leeway for more during the day if you have high blood pressure.<br /><br />However, I think this product is tasty enough that I will be buying more. That isn't true of the overstuffed beef ravioli.<br /><br />PS: Some reviewers claim that Amazon is selling seconds because some cans were dented. This is a very infrequent occurrence for me, and I tend to doubt that Amazon is selling something graded this way. Besides, I often see supermarkets selling dented cans--even more often than Amazon."

Of the 12 pods we had in the box, four were Green Mountain Coffee brand.  I'd never tried anything from this company before, but from what I had researched online, they have the largest range of Keurig pods and have even bought out competitors to produce coffee under their brand names as well.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I was immediately disappointed by the quality of the coffee.  We tried their Dark Magic, Decaf and Breakfast Blend and all were underwhelming, to say the least.  I was almost completely set on writing off Green Mountain altogther.<br /><br />We had one GM pod left and being of the mindset of waste-not-want-not, I figured I'd give it one last go around before forgetting about them completely.  And I'm glad I did.<br /><br />The Nantucket Blend is a perfectly pleasing cup of coffee.  It is nice and flavorful without being thick and pungent (unlike some of the other GM blends we tried).  I added some flavored creamer to it and it almost measures up to our go-to Caribou Blend pods.  Almost.  All in all, this is a very standard cup of coffee which, while it isn't anything new or exciting, is very pleasing and definitely one of the better Keurig options we've been able to test out.  When we run out of all the pods we've accumulated, I'll probably pick up a box of these as well.<br /><br />Now that I know Green Mountain isn't completely disappointing I'll definitely be open to trying a few more of their coffees (with our promotion for getting the bewer we ordered <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004I3Y4IE"">Green Mountain Coffee Golden French Toast,  K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 24-Count</a> to try as well) and see how it goes from there.<br /><br />If you're looking for a go-to choice, this is your cup!"

It is a little less sweet than sugar or Splenda so you might have to add a bit more to get the same taste.  The only problem with erythritol is that it doesn't break down easily in frostings or recipes that don't require some amount of cooking or baking.  I've found running it through a blender to break it down into a powder or mixing it with warm water before mixing it in removes the grainy texture and makes the erythritol easier to work with.

I happened to find Coffee People's Organic Extra Bold blend and was blown away.  It has been my favorite ever since I first tried it.  Last week I saw a listing for a Colombian dark roast sold under the Wolfgang Puck name (it is processed and distributed by Van Houtte) and decided to give it try.  Here is my impression of it:<br /><br />After brewing a cup (I used the 7 1/2 oz. setting) the first thing that I noticed was that it didn't have that freshly-brewed aroma that the Coffee People X-Bold does, however the taste was another story.  It hits your palate with medium acidity and a nice, sharp bite that gets your attention right away. The finish was surprising clean with a hint of spice (nutmeg or cinnamon?) and just a slight, lingering, pleasant bitterness.  I really like this coffee but I think that I will stick with Coffee People's Extra Bold and this will be my back-up brand.  However, I will keep looking for something new.

Since these are kettle-cooked, the chips are uniquely shaped and are sometimes a bit over-browned.  They are, however, sliced just perfectly, not too thick, not too thin, so you can actually get a great crunch with each bite without breaking a tooth off.  The flavor is tremendous, although I wouldn't describe it as Thai.  It's more of a vague, sweet and tangy flavor with a kick, and every now and then you get a great big hit of ginger.  If you like any spice at all, these really are not overly spicy, so most people can handle them.  The fact that these chips have absolutely no artificial ingredients or trans fat makes them a fabulous addition to any muncher's snack cupboard."

I had never tried Torani products before and I had wanted to try them as I heard good things about their sugar free syrups.  I have tried 4 of the flavors that I thought I would like.  They are so good that I have trouble believing that they are SUGAR FREE and FAT FREE!<br /><br />My two favorite flavors are Vanilla and Hazelnut. I stopped using fattening products in my coffee and stopped buying lattes and cappuccinos because they are so fattening.  However, my coffees were now so ordinary that I practically stopped drinking coffee.  Torani syrups changed all that! Both the Torani Vanilla and Torani Hazelnut are so incredibly good tasting, that they turn my so-so coffee into a lattee-like drink.  Wow!  It is hard to believe these syrups are sugar free and low in calories! The Torani Chocolate appears to be an equally good product although I was disappointed when it did not enhance my coffee.  Torani Chocolate is very strong which means that you should add less than you do with the Vanilla and Hazelnut flavors.  For Vanilla and Hazelnut, I add about 1/2 to 1 oz of syrup to a very large (12 oz) coffee.  Putting the same amount of Chocolate in coffee did not enhance the flavor.  In other types of shakes, I will probably use less than the usual amount of Chocolate.  I think it might be better in milk shakes.  Since I love Chocolate as a flavor, I should be able to find good uses for it.  I also love the Raspberry flavor in iced tea and it adds an interesting twist to lemonade.  I think Raspberry will be good with other fruity flavors.  Although I am disappointed in a few of the flavor bottles that came with this 6 pack, I am basically happy with the purchase.  The bottles that are good are REALLY GOOD!  Additionally, purchasing all 6 varieties gave me the chance to try a number of different Torani SF syrups that are yummy and let me know which to choose and which to avoid. I probably will not like either the Irish Creme or Classic Caramel flavors because I am not partial to these flavors by any beverage maker.  I will probably not open them and give these flavors away to someone who will appreciate them more than me."

So I rolled the end of the bag back up and gave it 15 more seconds. Still some did not fully ""explode"" or ""bloom"".  The second bag I started with 1 minute, 30 seconds. Slightly better results, but again I needed to re-roll the end of the bag and give it another 15-30 seconds, still using the 15 second intervals for best results.  The third bag I started with 2 minutes (which is also the amount of time that is used on my popcorn setting) and the results were not as good. Too many had over-cooked and were too hard to eat.<br />My suggestion would be to stick with the 1 minute with 15 second intervals, listening closely to the sound. (They emit a slight hissing sound when they expand).  As soon as the bag has fully opened and the hissing sound subsides, it's a good sign you have reached the optimal result.

It is a South American blend for those who prefer a brighter more acidic kind of brew, but is still well balanced and make s a fine cup of Java.<br /><br />The coffee comes in an attractive,  black bag with a bag with the now ubiquitous air valve.  The folks at Melitta know how to compact coffee for travel--all ambient air was sucked out of the bag, shrinking the usual size of the 10 ounces from its expected size, to a small, dense brick.  Cutting open the bag, there was an audible hiss as the bag seemed to expand to double its size.  The aroma was intoxicating--think deep coffee with chocolate hints and with nothing acrid about it.  The bag does not indicate the level of the roast, but on inspection the coffee appears to be a darker roast (somewhere between a `full city' and European).  The bag states that this is an extra fine grind, but on inspection it seems to be less powdery than you'd want for fine espresso, and is more of a fine grind.  This, I imagine, is meant a compromise so that the coffee is suitable for both the common drip coffee machines that use a filter or could be used with an espresso machine.<br /><br />For some reason, the instructions indicate that you should use two level teaspoons for every six ounces of water.  I'm not sure how they drink coffee in Europe, but in the US coffee machines measure by the cup.  This leads to a bizarre ~2.7 teaspoons of coffee per cup and (to my taste) a slightly weak cup of coffee.  In spite of the grind, I'd stick with the usual 1 tablespoon per cup proportion for your drip coffee maker and work up from there.  Your intuition should serve you well, and I'd stick with your usual measurements (I'm one of those `heaping' tablespoon per cup guys).<br /><br />The coffee definitely shows its South American origins.  In spite of the darkness of the roast and richness of the aroma, the coffee once  brewed is more light, breakfasty, and slightly more acidic than I imagined it would be. Given the type of coffee that it is, it also might have benefited from a slightly lighter roast. Still, it is a well balanced South American blend.  It lacks the distinctiveness of a single origin coffee but given that it is a blend has a more rounded, less biting flavor.  Although decaffeinating can sometimes sap the bold flavors of a coffee, this coffee still has a lot of personality and a distinctive taste.<br /><br />This is not for the pure coffee lover who likes a dark, earthy, and oily cup of java that can basically stand on its own.  This coffee is more for people who like to add a lot of buffer--a fair amount of milk and sugar or one of those Torani syrups (e.g. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E2QS"">Torani Syrup, Vanilla, 25.4-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 3)</a>) for a little extra flavor, for those who like those kind of things.  It also makes a great iced coffee.  If cold brewed, the coffee loses its tannic edge and is more smooth and sweet, but also loses a little personality in the process. (I did not try using this in an espresso machine as I do not have one, but I don't think that it would yield a great espresso.  Concentrated, I think the acidity might become overwhelming.)<br /><br />All in all, this is a fine blend of coffee at a fine price.  With a little experimentation on the proportions, it yields a fine cup of breakfast coffee."

The first, Apollo, is quite enthusiastic about food related assignments and is usually most concerned about quantity.  The second, LJ, is more discerning about food, occasionally refusing to participate.<br /><br />When I opened the first selection, Chicken Pot Pie I noticed a quantity of liquid around the solid portion of the meal and was concerned that it was perhaps spoiled.  I detected no bad odor so I offered it to my panel, who were incidentally becoming quite impatient.  Apollo immediately began to consume his portion, pausing only when the dish was empty.  LJ took her usual cautious sniff of the food and then began to eagerly lap up the liquid, pausing to take a bite of the solids from time to time.  She too did not stop eating until the entire portion was consumed.<br /><br />At the next testing session I offered the Chinese Chicken selection.  This one looked much more like other canned cat food but had a more pronounced odor.  Both testers arrived at their stations without being summoned.  Again both testers were enthusiastic about their assignments and did not stop until the entire portion was consumed.  In fact when the testers were disturbed by two members of the canine food testing team they expressed great displeasure.<br /><br />As I was preparing the food samples a member of the human food testing panel remarked that the feline samples, particularly the Chinese Chicken, looked better than much of the food she had been eating at college.<br /><br />Obviously the feline panel was quite taken with the product.  Our chief accountant had some issues with it however since this product costs about four times as much per ounce as our usual offering. (Note:  usual offering has kept six cats quite healthy for more than thirty years).  With this price factor in mind I divided each single serving (3 oz) can between the two testers and supplemented with dry food.<br /><br />Due to the enthusiastic endorsements by the feline food testers and based on my prior experience with aging felines' diminished appetites, I will purchase this product in the future as a supplement to the usual feline menu offerings, much as the human menu is supplemented by holiday meals or upscale restaurant outings."

A lot of people seem unaware that there are many other types of goat cheese on the market other than the ultra fresh Chevre.  I have purchased this selection by iGourmet for both myself and for others as gifts.  The reactions from my friends have been mixed.  They all enjoy the harder chesses, such as the Goat Cheddar and the Ibores.  However, some people don't like fresh, soft goat chesses and one of the reasons that I send them this selection is so that they can try a variety of different chesses.  However, in the selection that I was sent it contained two versions of Chevre-type cheeses including the delicious Buche de Chevre.  Still, I wished they had more of the harder to find goat milk versions of cheeses traditionally made from cow's milk such as the goat's milk Cheddar and Gouda.<br /><br />As for as price goes, this is a surprisingly good value.  You are getting two pounds of very expensive chesses for a little more than I have paid for one pound of some of the varieties here.  One of my friends did receive a substitution for one of the chesses.  Instead of the cheddar they received the Cypress Grove's Midnight Moon.  I can certainly understand why substitutions would be necessary and I felt that they replaced the listed cheese with an even better variety.  Overall I am very pleased with both the price and the quality of the cheeses, I just wish that they had less fresh and more unique forms of this wonderful type of chesse.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1423603680"">Goat Cheese</a>"

You can use it on 6 - 8 pieces of chicken, either bone-in or boneless. You simply moisten each piece of chicken, put the coating mix in a bag, put the chicken in the bag (one or two pieces at a time), and shake the bag until the coating mix covers each piece of chicken. Once that is done you put the chicken in an ungreased baking pan, heat the oven to 400 degrees, and cook for either 45 minutes (bone-in) or 20 minutes (boneless). You just stick it in the oven - no need to turn the chicken during cooking - and forget about it until it is done.<br /><br />Shake `N Bake Original Chicken Coating makes for a quick easy meal to prepare that tastes good. I have to confess that I'm not a particularly good cook and I don't have the patience to fix fancy meals but even I can't mess up when using Shake `N Bake. It is very easy to coat the chicken (although if you have large pieces of chicken you may run out of mixture) and it only takes a matter of seconds to rinse the chicken, coat it, and put it in the oven. You can use it on either bone-in chicken or boneless (for a quicker meal) and while both taste equally good, I prefer to use it on bone-in chicken. It tastes good (sort of like fried chicken) although a bit greasy. The pan can be a bit messy after cooking but it is still an easy cleanup.<br /><br />Shake `N Bake Original Chicken Coating is great when you need to fix a quick easy meal."

I think it's probably b/c it one of the few foods without bananas added.  It is a bit runny, so keep that in mind when using a spoon to feed.  But since it's so runny, it's good for younger ones that aren't used to thicker solids.<br /><br />The Spinach, Peas and Pears from Plum Organics is similar in taste, but is a little thicker, if the consistency of this one isn't right for you.  Also, we often mix this with some rice cereal to thicken it up if needed.<br /><br />I would recommend buying the variety pack to see which ones your kids might like.

But it gave my dog wicked gas..,"The recommendation when we bought our puppies (lhasa/bichon mix and lhasa/poodle mix) was that we continue them on the food that they have had since being weaned. This is a somewhat expensive food so I can't say that we were terribly pleased but we loaded up on the stuff and headed home.<br /><br />Let me just say this, I have had small dogs before. Never have I seen such gas issues. Both of them consistently had foul gas. Consistently. Usually when they're sitting on our laps but, you know. They're dogs.<br /><br />When we got through the first bag of this stuff, we purchased more on amazon. It was a great price for it since we got a 40 lb bag for the price of (I think) a 15 lb bag at Petco. But, they continued to have gas. I mean, they loved the food, don't get me wrong and they loved it more when we'd mix in some water and it would be like soft food. Somehow that made their gas worse but I think I'll have to give that responsible to the speed with which they chowed down- can't blame the food itself for gluttony.<br /><br />Eventually, we switched their food. No more farting. I think it was due to the high fat content which undoubtedly is necessary for very small puppies. They just need that in their diet. I think that we were advised to keep them on it for much longer than was useful (they said up until 1 year). Yeah right, you try dealing with gas for that long. Around 6 mos of age we switched to PuppyChow. Much better. Granted, they don't like it as much, but we humans like it a whole lot better."

While this milk is not as thick as the Mae Ploy brand I have tried in the past, I feel better knowing it was organically grown and that this particular company does not use BPA in their cans for coconut milk, or several other of their products. If more companies jump on the bandwagon I will try more brands but until then I am sticking with Native Forest.<br /><br />Added Aug 15th 2011:<br />I now see lots of negative reviews on this product due to sourcing from both Sri Lanka and Thailand. Reviewers have stated the poor quality watery ones are coming from Sri Lanka, which makes sense why I rated mine a 4 and liked mine, because mine were the Thailand kind that like other reviewers have stated, taste great. So be careful when ordering this product and make sure you get the Thailand kind! (will say this on the back of the label) As there is no way to know which Amazon is shipping out, it seems the best bet is to get them in a local store and check the back and get the good sourcing of coconut milk that will say Thailand.<br /><br />Added Oct 20th, 2012:<br />As commenters have posted as a response to my review, you are able to purchase a powder that you can mix with hot water if you wish to avoid cans and BPA at Wilderness Family Naturals website.<br /><br />Another option is the Tropical Traditions website shows how to make coconut milk with dried coconut at home. (They sell organic dried coconut on their website, so avoiding cans, less packaging, ethical sourcing) They sell quality coconut products, I have purchased many of their items.<br /><br />Lastly, I read recently on someone's blog that you can use the coconut cream concentrate found on the Tropical Traditions website to make coconut milk, that it is very cost effective. I have not ever tried this, however I add a bit to smoothies for my partner in the summer and he loves the taste. If I ever try these things out I will report back, however I just wanted to give ideas to folks who might see this if they do not want to go the canned milk route. :)"

I was looking for a reasonably priced food which was better in quality than the cheap chain crap. I didn't want to pay $2 a pound for a high quality food and Canidae was just right for my budget and quality needs. My dog loves it (but you can't really judge it on that alone as he is a lab and will eat anything) however his coat is nice, his stool is the right consistency, and he is hardly ever ill. He also NEVER EVER has gas (but he does burp from time to time but not smelly like others have mentioned.) I wasn't happy when the price increased and the quality supposedly dropped a bit but I am still happy with this food overall and have continued to use it. I am always on the lookout for high quality food at a reasonable price so if anyone knows of something high quality at around the same price point please respond to this post and let me know.<br /><br />On a different note, was I the only person who actually DID hear about the formula change before it was too late? When I went to purchase more food and saw that the 40lb bag was discontinued I went looking for a reason why and to make sure there weren't any other issues. Right on their website it mentioned the formula change, bag change, and the proper way to transition your dog from the old to the new food to avoid digestive issues. As I had 1 full bag of old formula left, I followed the instructions and guess what, no issues whatsoever with the transition. My dog did NOT get sick at all and has not had a single problem with this food new or old formula."

Holder ""The Review's the Thing""",2,2,4,1156636800,"Flavor in, Calories Down, Fat Nearly Out","As I get older and fatter, I seek opportunities to eat snacks that at least make a nominal attempt to be healthy.  Oreo cookies fail to reach very high on my list of healthy foods.  However, Oreo cookies are delicious beyond belief.  Not only are Oreo cookies delicious, but I sometimes think I hear Oreo cookies calling my name as I walk by them.  Honest.  I am unable to buy Oreo cookies because if I do I know I will eat them; generally in a few days.  Not a good idea.<br /><br />Nabisco, realizing that many of us are making some nominal attempt at eating more healthy foods, have created a brand-identified snack eliminates all the bad fats and most of the fat, creating a yummy and crunchy chocolate wafer snack that is like a chocolate cracker.  To this point no one has ever created a truly healthy snack that is like a cookie.  However, this wafer snack, which Nabisco has decided not to call a cookie, perhaps because cookie sounds fattening, is reasonably yummy.  I have eaten these things several times and still eat them.  I actually eat them more than regular Oreos, which I count as quite a nod to health.<br /><br />You may be tempted to add icing to this baked cookie.  If you are going to add the fat and calories in icing, perhaps you should just skip in pretense at reducing calories and fat and go straight to regular Oreo cookies.  In fact, just revel in the calories and go for the Double Stuff Oreos.<br /><br />Oreos have been around since 1912, and remain the best-selling cookie brand in history.  According to our friends at Kraft, which owns Nabisco, and which is owned by the Altria Group (renamed from Philip Morris, presumably for marketing reasons), more then 450 billion Oreo cookies were sold in the first 90 years of their existence.  Though Oreo Thin Crisps fall quite a bit short of the real thing, they are high quality and have sufficient flavor that allows these baked chocolate wafers to have the Oreo name.<br /><br />Of course, you could just stick with rabbit food and be truly healthy, but where is the fun in that?  For those of us that find a constant diet of veggies to be just too healthy to be fun, and yet the thought of pigging out on a pound of Oreos smacks of chunks of fat floating through our circulatory system, Oreo Thin Crisps are a lovely alternative.  Or course, you probably should avoid eating pounds of these, even with the reduced fat.  Food is food and too much low fat food still is not good for you, even if it tastes good.  At least Oreo Thin Crisps do not talk to me when I walk by.<br /><br />Enjoy!"

The previous Special Dark was 100% Dutched Cocoa, while the current Special Dark is a blend of Dutched and Natural Cocoas, so it isn't as dark or as strong as the previous one.  It is very good and has a pleasant fruity taste as compared to the more bitter and richer cocoa taste of its predecessor.  Initially I preferred the previous Special Dark, but am getting used to the new blend. The price is very good."

It advertises 'no sugar added' and '100% juice carbonated' and 'no preservatives', so I was expecting some sweet ~ this drink tastes like carbonated, watered-down orange juice, but it's actually a pretty good flavor, and packs 140 calories, 34g sugar and 36g carbs in a 'no sugar added'-'no corn syrup'- 'no preservatives'-'no artificial colors'-'gluten free' drink!  I would expect that from a juice like apple or cranberry, but I would also expect it to TASTE a bit more natural, and this one, like I said above, tastes like carbonated orange juice with tangerine ~ it's nice tasting, but too much in the way of calories & such for me to drink this very often.<br /><br />It was certainly good, but for the tastebuds of someone who WAS a lifelong soda drinker (diet soda for the past 12 years), and gave up soda a year ago(I very occasionally drink a carbonated beverage now) this is not the drink for me.

In fact, I don't even drink coffee, so the quest for the perfect hot chocolate for the Keurig is not one I take lightly.<br /><br />Of the brands of hot chocolate I've tried that are made specifically for the Keurig, this one is the best.<br /><br />I tried a couple of brews before I reviewed this...  So here's the conclusion that I've come to:<br /><br />I have a Keurig Special Edition B60 brewer, and the first brew I did as was suggested by the maker (shake the K-Cup before brewing, brew on 8oz setting).  Of course my brewer doesn't have 8oz, so I brewed at 7.25oz, the ""middle button.""  The result was a watery cup of hot chocolate with a fair amount of chocolate flavor, but still a little too watered down for me.  The color was really good, rich, dark, and even had some of that nice foamy goodness on the top.  I was *very* happy to see when I looked at the empty K-Cup after brewing that there was almost no powder or residue left in the K-Cup, a problem that the other hot chocolate K-Cups really suffer from no matter how hard you shake them and there was almost no thick chocolate gunk at the bottom of the mug when finished.  Awesome.  So overall, when brewed as suggested, it was the best hot chocolate I've tried for the K-Cup when prepared as-is, but not the best cup of homemade hot chocolate possible.<br /><br />The next brew I did I shook the K-Cup and brewed on the small cup setting, the 5.25oz brew.  The result was a hot chocolate that was a little thicker, beautiful color, lots of that spectacular white foam on top, something that looked like a REAL hot chocolate.  The flavor was much more defined, a lot more chocolaty, and very smooth and tasty.  Though I did notice that slightly Splenda-like aftertaste which kind of surprised me since I'm largely desensitized to that taste (thank you Fruit2O) and honestly it was ever-so-slightly just too sweet.  But wow was it good.  Still not the best hot chocolate to make at home, but really good.<br /><br />Third brew I did I did again on the 5.25oz brew, put a splash of half-and-half in the cup, then brewed.  Holy cow in a hat...  That was awesome.  Finally a substitute for my Dunkin Donuts trips.  So, so, so good.  No aftertaste, right amount of sweetness and creamy texture.  Great, rich color that looks like a melted Hershey Bar.  Right up there with the best hot chocolate one can make at home for sure.  For sure a taste that competes with hot chocolate I've tried from Dunkin Donuts.<br /><br />So rating this for me was hard...  When made, straight up as suggested, it's OK and even when it's made with less water it's pretty good.  Since I think the Keurig is designed for speedy ease-of-use, I think a lot of people are looking for and expecting that great cup of hot chocolate right out of the box.  In that way, it delivers an OK product, the best K-Cup hot chocolate available now, but not an overall great cup of hot chocolate.  But if you're willing to put two seconds worth of time into making it positively delicious, you will be very richly rewarded with fantastic hot chocolate.<br /><br />I fluctuated between rating 3 stars because, out of the box, it's only OK, and 4 stars because when adjusted it's amazing...  I ended up going 4 star with the assumption that there are a lot of people out there with a Keurig who do coffee or tea where they add creamer and/or sugar to adjust it to their taste, and I see doing this as much the same sort of thing.<br /><br />Hopefully Keurig will put out a hot chocolate soon that's amazing right out of the box.  If we could get them to talk to the Land O Lakes folks (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001M5RNTS"">Cocoa Classics Hot Cocoa Drink Mix 7 Variety Pack</a>), there would never be a reason to leave the house for hot chocolate again..."

I hadn't had them since I was a kid and wanted to see if they were similar to those I remembered.  My grandparents used to bring one for me and one for my sister every time they visited.  I also recall them being in glass jars on the counters of small stores as we drove ""up north"" to visit grandma and grandpa.  I don't know what brand they were, but they were almost identical to these Paskesz Fizz Pops.  The best way I can describe them is that they are like compressed confectioner's sugar with a very light fruit flavor.  Kind of like the texture of a sweet-tart, but without the tart.  If you suck on them like a regular lollipop, it will hurt your tongue and the roof of your mouth.  They don't dissolve in the same way that hard candy does.  Instead, you kind of chip away at them with your teeth and chew the little pieces that come off.  Now, if I didn't have this good childhood memory, I admit there's a chance that trying them as an adult for the first time, I might not be that excited about them.  But, it was fun to find them again.  Everyone in our family liked them.  And, I found one friend who remembered having these as a child, too and said ""Oh, I missed those lollipops that hurt your mouth if you sucked on them too hard!""  So, if you don't compare them to a regular lollipop and judge them on their own, you might find you like them, too."

But if you are a sincere chili head, and you better be if you're buying it, it's not as hot as you'd think. Because my temperament has adapted to intense levels of heat, spices/sauces that claim to be beyond insane tend to NOT be as hot as advertised. For serious - SERIOUS - chili heads, on a scale of 1-10, this is about a 7. The salt is really just that - salt. The balance in one bite is about 80 percent salt, 20 percent heat, but that ratio keeps it from being a scorching heat. That being said, I've figured it out enough to know what it's going to taste great on (spaghetti!), what it's going to add nice heat to (wings, of course), and where I can do without it.

Now with kids of my own, I decided to make Shake and Bake for my kids to try too.  The response was as good as I remember that I had - it's crispy and delicious!  Shake and Bake is really easy to make: simply put the Shake and Bake in a plastic bag, wet your chicken a little and toss in and SHAKE SHAKE SHAKE!  Bake it for about 45 minutes at 400 degrees and you'll end up with some crispy ""almost like fried"" chicken.  The flavor isn't too salty, and leans more on the mild side.  If you like it a little spicier, rub on a little tabasco before coating the chicken.<br /><br />This version of Shake and Bake doesn't come with the shaker bag included.  You will need to either 1) have a ziploc bag to put the chicken in, or you can just put the S&B in a pie dish (or other shallow dish) and coat it that way.  We don't like using too many bags, so we just used a large bowl and tossed the chicken around until coated.<br /><br />For people who are having problems with getting soggy bottoms on your chicken, an easy way to keep that from happening is to crumple up the foil and put the chicken on top.  This creates some air pockets under the chicken so that less of it is sitting on the foil.  If you're using chicken wings, you won't even have to crumple the foil because most of the chicken is off the pan.  You can also use a wire rack to make the whole chicken crispy.  Each pack can coat about 6 pieces (we did 2 each of wings, thighs, and drumsticks and had a little left over in the bowl)."

The pungency is not diminished during manufacturing.<br /><br />Served hot, it is perfect when you're sick.

My larger dog got some horrible gas, like she always does when we go through with food changes, and she seemed a bit bloated and crampy. That lasted about a day or two and she's been fine ever since. Well, old Sadie still has gas from time to time, but that's not uncommon for her size. At any rate, she's always gotten a case of the gas from time to time, just like her daddy (me).

When following direct instructions off of the Great Northern product you will be left with 20-40% kernals unpopped which is VERY disappointing.<br /><br />The fix for this is to only pop half of the contents (salt, oil, and kernals) one time around and then to make a 2nd batch with the remaining half.

Instead of being made with potato bits or mashed-up potatoes,  it's mainly potato flour and starch. Therefore, the potato flavor is lackluster to non-existent. They're more of a delivery method for the flavoring than a tribute to the great potato.<br />- The salt and vinegar flavor wasn't as strong as I'd hoped, especially since more salt and vinegar wouldn't really increase the calorie count very much. Also, because the underlying ""chip"" was kind of bland, more flavor would have been beneficial.<br /><br />Overall - a great snack alternative to chips.

But it is not super-wonderful-better than any other good quality soy sauce you can buy in an Asian market.  The main value is as a unique gift.<br />  In the Japanese soy sauce world, there are 4 types: regular, mild (usukuchi), for raw fish (sashimi) and light colored.  Bluegrass soy sauce is regular style.  Compared to Kikoman (a good commercial brand that is widely available) Bluegrass starts saltier, is flat in the middle, then ends with a complex & interesting flavor.  Kikoman is less salty initially and has a round, full flavor in the middle.  Doesn't have the complex ending flavors.  For me, the initial saltiness of Bluegrass is a minus and Kikoman's full middle flavor is a plus.  I prefere Kikoman, especially for dipping sushi where the flavor is more direct.  But I lived in Japan for many years and am used to the standard Japanese flavor.  I haven't tried Bluegrass blended in other food as a background flavor, which is how soy sauce is usually used.<br />  Bluegrass is a perfectly good soy sauce.  Each brand has a different flavor and everyone has their favorite.  If you want a unique Kentucky gift for an Asian friend, this is different than the standard bottle of Bourbon or box of chocolate."

It's probably five or six bites for me, and a couple crumbs will fall off as I nosh, but that's okay for me, now that I know.  A bit high in calories (180), but the number of carbs is low (23, before fiber content figures in), so it's a pretty safe treat when you have blood sugar considerations.  It's a darned tasty treat.

I haven't had the other canned brands to compare them with, but I was surprised at how good they actually were.  It's true they are on the mushy side, possibly because they are sitting in oil, I assume to keep from drying out.  And some of the leaves were torn, but none were falling apart and I had no trouble getting them out of the can intact.  They were wrapped very tightly.  The directions say to drain the oil, and that's good advice.  They tasted even better after doing that and refrigerating them.  They have a lemony taste, but not too strong.  Couldn't even taste the mint.  They use sunflower oil, which I don't think is as good as olive oil, but most of the canned stuffed grape leaves seem to do the same, probably because it's cheaper.  The recipe I prefer has a lot of dill and onions and lemon and uses extra-virgin olive oil (a Greek recipe), and the Roland  has no dill.  But for the price I thought these were definitely worth buying.  I certainly won't have a problem eating them in a few days.  I've never frozen grape leaves before, but I don't see why it couldn't be done.  I doubt these are the best canned stuffed grape leaves out there (the Al-Wadi and Divina have better ratings), but they are good enough for me, especially for the price.  And they are vegetarian."

Its got a great flavor full of nuttiness and sure presses better than du Monde (almost no grounds at bottom of cup), but its still not the ca phe sua da Im used to.  For one, the color is a definite brown, not black and it isnt strong.  Ill give the Creative #1 a try which says its a dark and strong robusta coffee (no blend), compared to this which is a blend of nearly everything.<br /><br />So if you are looking for a great tasting coffee full of complex flavors that are beyond what I can describe, give this a try... you wont be disappointed to the least.  But, if you are looking for that really strong, jet black coffee that can strip paint off a car and wake up dirt, and that when mixed with condensed milk turns into a rich golden-brown concoction that is ca phe sua da, then you need to look elsewhere (like that Creative #1... possibly)."

The pear taste is not as strong as the RW Knudsen's sparkling pear, and the carbonation is on par with the other Kristian Reg&aacute;le drinks I've tried, though it's a bit more mild than the Pomegranate, and much more mild than the Lingonberry. It's light bodied and the citrus acid gives it just a tiny acidic kick. Comparing only the taste, and not the carbonation, it's terribly dissimilar from Martinelli's.<br /><br />The mild, yet pleasant taste makes this easy to pair with.

Definitely has a sweet potato flavor, so if you don't like that vegetable, you probably won't like the flavor of these.  One bag (0.8 oz or 23 g) contains 19 chips, has 100 calories, 3 g of fat, 95 mg of sodium, and 45 mg of potassium.  That isn't bad compared to many other snack foods.  For example, a comparable size bag of regular potato chips would have about 130 calories and 8 g of fat.  However, these Popchips don't taste like regular potato chips.  If you like the fatty, salty flavor of regular potato chips but are trying to cut back, I would recommend a reduced fat kettle chip variety instead.<br /><br />After reviewing the ingredients of these ""natural"" Popchips, they are not as healthy as I expected.  The first two ingredients are rice flour and sweet potato FLAKES.  The remaining ingredients are tapioca starch, sunflower, safflower, and/or canola oil, organic yellow corn flour, seasoning (sea salt, dried cane syrup, maltodextrin, sweet potato powder, natural flavor, citric acid), sugar, and annatto (natural color).  They contain no fiber nor vitamin A, which I would expect to find in a sweet potato product.<br /><br />All in all, the Sweet Potato Popchips are not a bad snack to munch on when compared to many other processed snacks foods.

The Stella and Chewy food comes in smaller tater tot shapes which unfortunately, depending upon the way they are packed to be shipped can arrive crushed.  For some reason, the crushed food does not appeal to my cat.  In addition, it is difficult to decide just how much food to give the cat--once reconstituted, the food will go to waste if the cat, like mine, decides not to eat it all.

I purchased a bottle of their olive oil produced in Chilli that was lighter color but it tasted so great that seemed like I was having olives straight from the tree and amazingly I paid only $6.49. I have been consuming olives and olive oil for years and years for its nutritional value. I cook with olive oil or use it as dressing or add few spoons into my dish since I need the good unsaturated fat contained in olives in in my diet. All vegetable oils are processed and diluted including LIGHT or EXTRA LIGHT olive oil which is a highly refined oil without the nutritional value. I use much more expensive EXTRA VIRGIN olive oils which taste very fruity and sharp from EU but I have been to their farms and know the product real well and trust the producer as well. Unfortunately, olive oil being the gold standard of the cooking oil is produced and mixed with other oils and adulterated by many for financial gain but not this one since it is pure olive oil from a reputable seller but as I said it is not organic.

In Spain, a sweet is made of small marzipan balls covered with pine nuts, painted with egg and lightly cooked. Pine nuts are also featured in the salade landaise of southwestern France. Pine nut coffee, known as pi&ntilde;&oacute;n (Spanish for pine nut), is a speciality found in the southwest United States, especially New Mexico, and is typically a dark roast coffee having a deep, nutty flavour; roasted and lightly salted pine nuts can often be found sold on the side of the road in cities across New Mexico to be used for this purpose, as well as a snack. The Nevada, or Great Basin, pine nut has a sweet fruity flavor and is relished for its large size, sweet flavor and ease of peeling.""

It is sturdy enough to be enjoyed with milk or sweetener, yet has little harshness when consumed black.<br /><br />Twinings of London was founded in 1706, and is known internationally for marketing teas of consistency and value. Twinings English Breakfast Tea was originally blended to complement the traditional, hearty English Breakfast, from which its name derives. Twinings literature tells us that this is a blend of Kenyan and Assam black teas.<br /><br />Tea enthusiasts generally prefer loose tea to tea bags which contain less expensive, smaller particles and the ""fannings"" or ""dust"" remains from processing of loose leaf tea. Moreover, you can sometimes taste the paper used in bags, especially in the weaker teas.<br /><br />However, this Twinings loose tea has no uncut leaves. The blend uses only small particles that infuse more quickly than whole leaves. This blend approaches full strength within just a couple minutes. To avoid excessive particulate matter in your drink, use a strainer or infuser with a fine mesh. (Amazon sells Tovolo, Teeli, and Frieling/Swissgold filters with very small openings in their screens.)<br /><br />This product is a fine introduction to the world of loose tea. Would I rank it as my favorite tea or even my favorite Twinings? No, but I keep some available for when I want the pleasure of plain ol' tea. (As an aside, I would rank Twinings' Earl Grey a bit higher in quality. It is a whole leaf tea with just the right amount of bergamot orange flavoring. I don't think of it as an everyday tea, but I enjoy it as an occasional pleasure.)"

The smell is a nice vanilla, but the taste and texture took a little getting used to. The first day I tried it, I thought is was a bit grainy and watery with too mild of a taste. Then, around my third morning of trying it, I found that I actually started to like it! I do think it is fairly filling, but I don't eat it alone. I always have at least a piece of fruit (or cup of berries) with it plus a coffee with 1TBSP of half-and-half. Sometimes I also have a poached egg (in microwave). All those together leave me satisfied for about 3 hours (with or without the egg).<br /><br />Since I've been eating the Kashi Hot Cereal fairly consistently, I decided to see how it would be to have cold cereal instead. So one morning I had 1.5 servings of Puffins cereal with 1/2 cup of skim milk and a piece of fruit. I was definitely hungry in about 60-90 minutes. I've been really focusing on paying attention to my hunger as I try to lose weight, and 60-90 minutes is not a long enough period for me. So I've been sticking with the hot cereal more often than cold cereal now.<br /><br />On a side note, in the past 2.5 weeks, I've lost about 11 pounds eating this for breakfast (but I changed ALL my eating habits, so don't conclude it was the hot cereal alone that did it! I also started eating ~5-6 serving of fruits and vegetables a day, eating high fiber foods, very little processed foods, almost no foods with sugar added, etc).  Also, due to back problems, I have not been able to exercise at all during this time - so it really was just changing my eating habits that led to the weight loss.<br /><br />I gave this a 4 out of 5 stars because while I think I kinda like it now, it's not that great tasting and the texture is still a bit funny. I will continue to purchase this product because I do like that it is filling (when I also include fruit) and high in fiber and protein (7g and 9g respectively)."

Smooth, Not Bitter, Plenty Strong But Not Too Strong.","NOTE: This one is better for me at the smallest cup setting, which makes it stronger.<br /><br />This is my first time to try Wolfgang Puck coffee. I have mixed feelings about it so far. The Rodeo Drive Blend is a little more 'bland' than I'm used to, which is great for people who prefer that. It's just a different taste, which is good or not-so-good, depending on each person's preference. Personally, ever so often I take a sip of Rodeo Drive Blend and think that it almost tasted like dishwater. Then that goes away and I enjoy the rest of the cup of coffee. I think that reaction is because it isn't as strong and bold as I'm used to, but it's pretty good. I can see that some people might make this their favorite because it is different.<br /><br />Will I buy this again? No. It's good, but it's not my preference, and I might as well buy the ones that make me rave on and on about how good they are, usually Tully's French, Kona, Italian, and House. Those may be too strong for some people, and the Rodeo Drive Blend does have its own unique taste which may really appeal to some coffee drinkers. As with most things, actually a little more than in most things, with coffee, it's a matter of taste and probably a matter of what you are in the habit of drinking. You may want to try this one, especially if you can find it in a sample packet, or do like I do, keep the rest for guests to try."

The other flavors I have tried didn't taste bad, but really didn't taste like the flavors they were promoting.  This soda tastes both like kiwi and berry.

The flavor is just right, not too sweet or too savory, and doesn't have a strong chicken flavor. Almost like plain sweet potatoes but not as sharp, thus it's a very good first protein to offer, and good for picky eaters. My nephews and my niece also liked this flavor, so it's a pretty safe bet to keep on hand if you don't know a particular baby's preferences.<br />Something I wish I had known was that it is quite a bit runnier than other Stage 2 Earth's Best, especially for having chicken. I added quite a bit of rice cereal to thicken it up after my daughter had gotten tired of the runny texture, and she liked that just fine, but it is an extra step. However the runnier texture makes it workable for younger babies or those with gagging/texture problems."

I can remember eating them as a kid as far back as the 1970s, and I still occasionally eat them today. They have a distinctive corny taste which, as far as I know, is unlike anything else currently on the market. On the basis of taste alone, this product would rate 5 stars, however, I am only giving 4 stars out of 5 because of the high staurated fat content, something that is easily evident from a glance at the nutrition label. Bugles have much higher saturated fat content than many other snacks - a result, I suppose, of coconut oil (rather than vegetable or corn oil) being a main ingredient. I wonder, why can't they make Bugles lower in saturated fat and overall fat content, and would it really taste any different?"

It's also pretty instant and fills you up, even if you need to eat two packets at a time to actually feel full.  However, it's not something you have to feel guilty about eating since it's oatmeal and the fat/calories in a serving aren't going to crash your diet.  Unlike all the complainers, I'm not addicted to the ""original"" flavor and honestly couldn't tell you there was a difference between this and the ""old"" version.  Basically, if you don't eat it five days a week, you probably won't notice the difference.<br /><br />Overall I like the texture of this as well.  I tend to make mine straight from the packet and with boiling water from an electric kettle and sometimes I've had products that don't mix well that way and I'm stuck eating crunchy oats instead of, well, the proper gooey kind.

As such, it's about as sweet and flavorful as regular juice. The sparkling water gives it a little different sort of fizz from regular soda's. Although these cans are only about 2/3 the size of regular soda cans, it's relatively filling and a single can makes for a decent drink. Sure, it has a fair amount of sugar, but it's not a diet product. And for most people, it's better to drink the natural sugar in fruit juice than the chemicals in most sodas.<br /><br />There are two problems: the price and the flavors. At nearly a dollar a can, even when purchased by the case, this is expensive stuff. One could simply buy some juice and some sparkling water and make a fair approximation without spending so much. The other issue is the fact that the recipe contains more apple and grape juice than kiwi or cherry juice. This isn't uncommon for juices made from expensive fruits, but in this case it's really noticeable.  However, it's less noticeable than it was in the Switch Black Cherry flavor -- the kiwi definitely stands out.  (If you're deciding between the two, go with Kiwi Berry.)  If you don't like apple or grape juice, that could be enough to ruin this drink for you."

I confirmed this with customer service.  Leaving the remaining review as it was...<br /><br />*********************<br /><br />My wife had made her own baby food for our daughter for the first eight months. Then, when our daughter was going to begin daycare, there was a certain convenience factor of being about to send in jars of baby food for her and so we bought Earth's Best. It was organic, and figured to be the closest bought brand to what she had been making herself. The variety packs are a nice, easy way to stock different kinds for our baby to enjoy... and enjoy she did for several of the flavors, though some she hated as well. All in all, we were pleased, and baby seemed pleased, though I will say, she didn't seem to like these gourmet ones any better or any worse than the less expensive <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BM6LVS"">Earth's Best Organic 2nd Dinner Variety Pack, 4 Ounce Jars (Pack of 12)</a>.<br /><br />Needless to say, I was pretty surprised to read a review about BPA in the lids at <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BM395E"">Earth's Best Organic 2nd Fruit Variety Pack, 4-Ounce Jars (Pack of 12)</a>, (and so I posted my review there as well).  I spent some time trying to verify this myself. A lot of different blogs stated it, and while I couldn't find anything definitive, here's what bothered me: Clearly Earth's Best knows people are concerned about BPA in their lids... their own facebook site is littered with people asking this same question. The admin answers these the same way... food safety and baby health is of the highest priority, call us to discuss. That's only slightly paraphrased. Going to their website, they have zero articles on BPA and none in the FAQs section either... nothing. I'm not worried enough about the issue to stop using what we purchased, but I would have felt a whole lot better about the company and their products if they would acknowledge parents' concerns and tell parents... something. Hey, we check our food in laboratory testing regularly and the the amount of BPA found in our food is X, which is so low, there are no health concerns... just say something... anything. Do you really want the onus on the customer to contact you to keep using your product?<br /><br />As I was taking the time to review their product, I decided I would call them to give them a fair chance to explain. Something, I likely wouldn't have done if I wasn't writing a review. Their office was closed... 9AM - 7PM est. Not the most convenient times for a working parent, but I will attempt to follow up and update this accordingly.<br /><br />****UPDATED (old)****<br />Just spoke to someone from customer service.  She says that the liner that comes into contact with the food is BPA free, but that there is another section of the lid behind this liner, that does contain BPA, but that section of the lid does not come in contact with the food.  I'm sure not everyone will be okay with that answer, but I'm ok with it.  I still think it should be an answer that's readily available to consumers without calling them, but I will say there was no hold time at least."

In the video, I have just placed down three plates of catnip from freshly opened packages. The brands from left to right are <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00028HN5A"">Sojos Certified Organic Catnip</a>, in the middle is the product in this listing - <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005CGUTGC"">Cosmic Catnip Jar, 3-Ounce</a>, and on the far right we have <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VNEII0"">Frontier Catnip Leaf & Flower C/s Certified Organic, 16 Ounce Bag</a>.<br /><br />Like the little bear at Goldilock's table, Tristan tries a bit from each plate; at the end of this clip he seemed to have no *overwhelming* preference for any particular brand though. As far as his physical reactions to each (sampled separately), he did not act ""stoned"" nor hyper, he merely scratches on his scratch pad a bit more with catnip than without catnip and gives himself a good stretch. He also strongly prefers catnip infused mice to non-catnip mice and I'm happy to oblige.<br /><br />As far as which *I* prefer, if it's all the same to the cat (and it seems that it is) here's my take on things -<br /><br />The Frontier brand is by far the least expensive at just under fifteen dollars for 16oz. It is slightly more coarse and seems to have a little bit of stems mixed in. VERY fragrant though and turned out to be a close second favorite of the cat reviewing the products. I would definitely buy the Frontier brand again and use it for stuffing toys generously or for ""marinating"" his little cloth mice. Organic and suitable even for human consumption if you like it as a tea.<br /><br />The Sojos brand (1oz can) is the most expensive - by my calculations comes to over a hundred dollars for 16oz!. The description says it produces a ""harmless, euphoric state"" but we saw no evidence of that. Smelled fresh but definitely a milder aroma than the other two brands; had the finest chopped leaves of the three. Hand harvested if that is important you or your cat.<br /><br />With the Cosmic Cat brand, we *may* have a winner.....<br /><br />When the camera was off, Tristan returned to the Cosmic Cat sample several times more so than the other brands. I repeated this little taste test for the next two days and Cosmic Cat had a small but definite edge over the competition. I'd have to say that I agree with his choice; the Cosmic Cat brand leaves are darker and more fragrant than the other two brands. The leaves are also cut just right - not too fine/not too large, and no stems or coarse pieces. I find the Cosmic Cat brand's price reasonable, the storage container is very convenient, and the 3oz size is enough not to be too little and not so much to get stale and spoil.<br /><br />Hope you find this information useful in choosing for your own cat or kitten."

The ginger taste prevails and is quite strong. Fortunately, I like ginger. I'm a big fan of ginger beer, for example (when I can find it).

I went in with hopes that combining two good things together would result in something better than the two separately.  In this case the result is pretty good.  While this is only mentioned on the product page (and not the actual container itself), the lid doubles as a measuring cup for a single serving.  After having these over the last few days, here are my impressions.<br /><br />While I like the taste (a lot!), it wasn't exactly what I was expecting.  When I think of dark chocolate, I'm expecting a taste similar to a piece of Dove Dark Chocolate miniatures.  It is a taste that is rich with a very mild sweetness.  The coating on these almonds is a little bit sweeter than that.  It's nowhere near milk chocolate, but like I said it wasn't exactly what I expected.  That said these are still really good.  The almonds themselves are great with only a minute amount of salt.  With the chocolate and the natural flavor of almonds this is a sweet treat.<br /><br />Who It's For:  Disciplined people looking for a sweet, but healthy snack.<br /><br />Suggested Use:  A single serving makes a great between meals snack.  If your stomach starts to rumble around 10 a.m., this will bridge the gap to lunch.  I have the canister in a desk drawer at work.  Regardless of when/where/how you use them as snack, discipline and moderation are key.<br /><br />Potential Improvements:  The one thing that bugs me on these is that the 11 oz package does not divide evenly into 1.5 oz servings.  It would seem like a 12 oz canister would have been easy enough.<br /><br />Overall:  This is a great tasting, healthy snack to enjoy in moderation."

It does have some dusting of a white fructose sprinkle as perhaps a nostalgic tribute. Don't get me wrong, as the Oreo Thin Crisps are perfectly fine as low-calorie chocolate wafer alternatives go. They simply lack the lip-smacking satisfaction of a disassembled Oreo digested in pieces.

Rich.  Nicely roasted and balanced.  Full flavored.  If you don't like any of those characteristics, then this review won't do much for you.  Anyway, I'm pretty tired of Starbucks.  It's overly roasted, almost to a burnt sensation, and drips a bit too much with bitterness.  I tolerate it because most of the other coffee vendors in the area sell watered down garbage.  A little while back, Melitta was offered on Vine and I figured, why not give it a try.  Boiling water, 4 minutes in a french press, and some milk and sugar, and I'm in business.  Surprisingly, it was a great cup of coffee.  Nice depth, a lovely balanced and almost creamy texture, great roast, and not exceedingly bitter or sludgy.  The real test now is for me to do a head to head against my current favorite go-to: Illy.  I have a feeling that Melitta may hold up pretty well."

I've tried it and it tastes pretty good to me too. Rare in the baby food industry.<br /><br />I am following a weaning guide that I used for my daughter, and it makes you pretty wary of commercial baby foods as babies easily get used to the bland, watery taste and sometimes take a lot of coaxing to go back to home made, healthy meals, resulting in picky toddlers and children. My daughter is now 3 and has never refused a home cooked meal yet, and I attribute that to the hard work I put in in the first year. Another problem with commercial baby foods is that they are usually so padded out with water that nutritional needs aren't fully met during the day and babies can start waking in the night due to genuine hunger.<br /><br />I'd love to ask, who came up with the magical 4oz measurement for all stage 2 baby food jars and packets, though? My son takes more like 6oz of my home prepared meals which are much ""fuller"", so I've had to add a little sweet potato to this to increase the volume. And it does seem really quite runny and padded out with water, so I add a teaspoon or 2 of rice cereal to thicken it up a little. Before long, I'm sure he'll just be on 2 full 4oz jars when I give him this.<br /><br />All that said, I'll reiterate, it is really quite tasty for a commercial baby food, and I have no problem giving it to my son once in a while.

Unfortunatley, I had bought a whole box of that same chocolate milk in the store before I had a chance to try it.  After some research, I came across the Cafe Escapes brand, which makes a chocolate milk for the Keurig, and in my opinion, is the best of the chocolate milks available for the Keurig.  It has a creamy taste, like chocolate milk made with milk, even though you're using water to create it.  It's full of flavor and in my opinion, what a good chocolate milk should taste like.  Now I've read opinions where people think it has an after taste, which I didn't perceive, but to each their own.  I thought the flavor was amazing.

We gave up mac and cheese reluctantly and tried several ""other"" brands to satisfy the craving. None could compete. If you grew up on Kraft mac 'n' cheese with the bright yellow might-be-cheese sauce, you miss it.  My daughter loves mac but would only get it at ""Grandma's"" house because I didn't keep it around much.  I was excited to find out about this product, but only to find no local stores who carried it. Thank you, Amazon! It is well worth the price and tastes just like the original, just with a stronger wheat flavor.  I felt the cheese sauce should be made a little stronger to compensate for the strong wheat flavor of the pasta. We don't mind the wheat taste, but some other people aren't as fond of it. If you don't care for the taste of whole wheat pasta, this probably isn't for you. We, however, will definitely reorder."

I came home, read a magazine, he sat quietly on the sofa beside me happily chewing and by the time I had finished my magazine he had finished his bone.  While certainly not a long lasting chew it is something I'd pick up again when I get bird food since I know he enjoys it.

They're pretty similar with the same calories and grams of fat, but when it comes to nutrients the Safeway version is slightly more nutritious.

Delicious!!,"I have a Keurig coffee maker, which brews a fresh cup of gourmet coffee, tea, or cocoa in less than a minute. If you are not familiar with this machine, it is wonderfully convenient, especially for me, as I only make 1 or two hot beverages at home per day. But I am not reviewing the Keurig coffee maker. I am here to write a glowing review for ""Milk Chocolate Hot Cocoa K-Cups for Keurig Brewers.""<br /><br />In the winter hot cocoa is my favorite coffee alternative, and I recently tried Cafe Escapes Milk Chocolate Hot Cocoa K-Cups. Caf&eacute; Escapes Cafe Mocha used to be my favorite brand/blend. However, I now find this Milk Chocolate Cocoa K-Cup absolutely delicious and, by far, the best K-Cup cocoa I have sampled to date. I have tasted 2-3 other brands and flavors, but nothing compares to the full, rich, creamy flavor of this product - much more so than the Cafe Mocha, which is also good but not as creamy.<br /><br />I respectfully disagree with those reviewers who have given Cafe Escapes Milk Chocolate Hot Cocoa a poor rating, especially those who didn't care for what they stated was the taste of sucralose, an artificial sweetener. I have a relatively sensitive palate and am usually aware of these artificial flavorings and sugar substitutes. I do not taste these here, nor does my daughter, who also loves hot chocolate....and she is REALLY picky! Of course, this does not taste like the hot chocolate made with whole milk and shaved chocolate - but it is an excellent substitute.<br /><br />It is important to remember to shake the K-Cup before brewing any kind of hot beverage.<br /><br />This product contains milk, soy and tree nuts (highly refined coconut oil). Product is trans-fat and gluten free. Caffeine content is estimated at less than 10 mg per serving (versus 100-150 mg in Arabica coffee).

This is not a good combination, especially on stressful days at work :)  I have tried decaf, and many different coffee brands to see which will have the least negative impact with varying results.  This is the first time trying ""low-acid"" coffee for me.<br /><br />I normally buy whole bean coffee and grind it myself, this coffee was already ground and was not nearly as fresh as I would like, but the initial aroma was still good. I prepared it with a french press at home using purified water at 190 degrees.  I let it steep for four minutes and then tested the aroma again.  It reminded me of the typical store brand type coffees, not bad, but not as layered as I am used to.<br /><br />I sampled it first as regular black coffee with nothing added.  It has the right flavor and character for a french roast, with a little bitter aftertaste that I felt was appropriate.  Then, I added half & half with the second cup which is how I usually drink it.  This being my preference, the flavor improved to just above average.  However, after two cups and an hour wait, I am not having any symptoms of heartburn or acid reflux that I would normally have which is a nice improvement.  In fact, I am surprised how little this has bothered me.<br /><br />In summary, while this coffee being already ground was not a fresh as I am used to, it is much easier on my stomach than any other brand I have tried so far and the flavor is good enough that I would try it again.  Could this be a daily coffee for me? Probably not, unless there is a way to take the acid out before it is ground.  I would love to try a version of that."

Hodgkin ""chodgkin""",1,1,4,1337558400,"Previous delight, recent disappointment","I have loved ginger since my father introduced me to it over fifty years ago.  I have tried many brands, and was delighted to find this ginger on Amazon.  I ordered it several times and was highly satisfied with it, finding it had excellent texture (many gingers sold in the US are hard lumps, but this has the proper ginger texture), bite (good sharp ginger flavor without an excessive bite), and sugaring.<br /><br />However, the last order I received was a disappointment. I have waited through about a dozen bags before posting this somewhat negative review, hoping the first few were just an anomaly, but sadly no.  The issue is that, while in all previous orders the ginger consisted almost entirely of bite sized chunks, this recent order is an almost equal mixture of those chunks and small to tiny sized pieces which, because they are sugared over their entire surface areas, give almost entirely a sugar taste with little ginger bite.  The bite sized chunks are still as good as before, but the other half of the bag is a great disappointment and not at all what I have been used to from this company.<br /><br />I don't know whether the company is having trouble getting enough quality ginger to fill their orders and is filling their bags out with scraps which I would have expected to be used for ground ginger, in ginger beverages, or otherwise than as crystallized bites; whether they have decided to fill their bags with these bits to keep their costs down; whether my order was simply filled from the bottom of the batch and the problem wasn't caught in time; or whether there is some other reason, but whether intentional or inadvertent, this is not the product I used to get and is not the quality product I think customers have a right to receive.<br /><br />When this order is exhausted I will probably try the product again, hoping that it has returned to its prior quality, but if not, sadly I will have to resume my search for a quality ginger to enjoy."

I had found and tried this Twinings Gunpowder Green (loose) tea at a local Fresh Market.  I enjoyed it, but getting to that store (and their having it in stock) was troublesome.  I was very happy to see the same tea on Amazon for a bit over a dollar LESS (per tin) than my local cost (not including my travel time or tolls paid).  The tea has a very nice flavor (FAR better than the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5QPU"">Stash Premium Green Tea, Loose Leaf, 3.5-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 3)</a> which was the other green tea I'd found locally).  It also has a good color and aroma.  One of the things I like about gunpowder tea is that it's easy to portion out.  I scoop out 1 level teaspoon of tea and use it for two full serving in my <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010NR7C0"">Bodum YoYo Personal Tea Set with Infuser and 12-Ounce Glass</a>.  The tea leaves are of sufficient quality that there are almost no fragments, so nothing gets through the infuser but the flavor.  If I were a tea purist, I'd probably have some issue with the fact that the gunpowder rolls of leaves are not as tight as they should be and the spent leaves look like they're somewhat irregular.  But, considering that this tea is many times less expensive than the high quality stuff from the specialty shops, I'm very happy with it.  The one thing I'm just a touch worried about is storage.  The six tins in this package will last me many months.  Since each tin is opaque and is sealed with an aluminum film, I figured the best location for storing the tea until I moved it to my ""in-use"" spot would be the refrigerator.  The tin and the film should keep light and moisture out and the temperature fluctuations should be minimal.  But, I still worry a bit.  Still, I'm very pleased with the tea and rate it at a Very Good 4 stars out of 5."

I did like that there was green onions in with the seasoning. This was better than the usual peas and carrots that are on the top of a Cup O Noodles.<br /><br />I didn't like the bowl that the soup came in. When it had hot water in it, it became really flimsy. I was afraid that the edge was going to cave in and I would get burned from the hot water.<br /><br />In the end, this was basically a Cup O Noodles soup. It tasted just like a Cup O Noodles except that they seasoning package was separate and you had to pour that into the soup before messing with water.<br /><br />At the moment, Amazon does not have a price listed for these so I don't know how cost effective they would be.

They have a less intense pork flavor than the best pork rinds, but having them hot helps compensate. Amazingly, pork rinds are becoming ""diet food.""

Although my dogs will eat anything, they were especially excited about these treats.<br /><br />The quality of ingredients is excellent.  No grains--just freeze-dried meats, fruits and veggies, with some spices, and preserved with vitamin E.  They smell VERY chicken-y, moreso than conventional treats.  The freeze-drying gives these biscuits an odd texture, kind of like cardboard.  They hardly weigh anything.<br /><br />While the quality is good, there are a couple of negatives.  First is the cost.  My box only contained 18 treats.  I have two big dogs, so if I gave them each three cookies/day (not unusual), this box would last us... three days.  Second, while the size is fine for a larger dog, you'd have to break them for a smaller dog.  This makes a huge, crumbly mess.  Third, after eating one, both dogs do this weird smacking thing with their tongues for a full minute, as if part of the treat is stuck to the roof of their mouths.  I don't know if this is bothersome for them, but it drives me insane.<br /><br />Overall, I'm giving this 4 stars based on the quality of ingredients, but I would not buy these because they're just not economical.

The size of the product does seem to convey this. At 8.3 oz, this is something a lot of people could finish in one or two gulps.<br /><br />The flavor is nice and tasty. You can taste both the berry and kiwi.  No funny aftertaste and it goes down easily.  It is not tart nor is it too sweet. The carbonation isn't too overpowering. It's not as strong as a soda but it's not on it's last fizzy breath either.  I could see the bubbles disappearing faster than soda after sitting out for a while.<br /><br />All in all, I'd say this is a nice alternative to your average soda/juice box.  It'd be perfect for kids to drink in school.  My only suggestion is to make the can a little bigger as there's just not enough juice to completely quench your thirst for the price that you are paying."

I've never used it on pasta because I don't care for pasta.  But I use it as a seasoning.

It's quiet, muted, with no bold reds or other screaming colors, no out-of-place graphics or strange fonts.  I like the nice soft tan/sand with a strong, healthy blue and chocolate brown, a very good palette to match with the product.  The package is pleasing to the eye, and shows the product well.  That's coming from a guy closing on 50; this probably would be the perspective of a younger demographic.<br /><br />When it comes to soft cookies, all are measured by the inimitable standard of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00512RI1Q"">Archway</a>.  Is it as good as an <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006R0AG4W"">Archway</a> soft cookie?  Well, this product is not.  Sorry.  But, this is not to say this is a bad cookie.<br /><br />Each cookie is individually packaged, six to a box.  The cookie measures just short of 3.5"" across (that's a nice round 90mm for our international friends).  Thankfully, there is none of that really artificial, factory smell of preservatives and softeners that you can get with many soft cookies.  That is a big plus for this product.<br /><br />My experience with six of these cookies is that there's an awful lot of oatmeal, and not really that much chocolate or almonds.  The dark blotches of chocolate and the whitish blotches of almond pieces are visible enough on/in the cookie, top or bottom (not like the photos on the package, naturally), but neither really comes through in either mouth texture or taste.<br /><br />I also found these to be somewhat dry.  A couple of the cookies had started to break/fracture right out of the packaging, and this may have been a function of how dry they were.  They are soft cookies, well, soft enough, but they don't have that resistance to pulling them apart, none of that sexy pull-apart squishiness you get in the TV commercials.<br /><br />Although the box tells you that this is a good source of fiber (true) and that you're getting wonderful <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002UT5H3E"">Quaker whole-grain oats</a>, this is not a sugar-free or otherwise clearly good-for-you product.  It's sugar and chocolate, at 180 calories and 70g of fat per cookie, more than 1,000 calories in the box.  This product is not about diet or longevity--it is about indulgence.  And guilt.<br /><br />Bottom line: would I eat a box of these to save the rain forest?  Sure.  Would I encourage an unattractively thin model to eat one?  Yes.  Would I feed them to my family?  Yes.  Would I eat one instead of an Archway apple-filled oatmeal?  Sorry, no way.  Soft-cookie technology has advanced by leaps and bounds in our lifetime, a testament to the thousands of dedicated and bespectacled men and women working in the deeply buried top-secret cookie development bunkers around the world, but they need to stay down there and keep working a little harder.  This one is pretty good, but still not quite there."

Even years after he left the scouts I remained involved at the large regional camp here for the boy scouts teaching survival training. And I still do a lot of hiking and camping on my own. Powdered spices, veggies, cheeses, bullion, and various stocks were a staple item on camping trips due to their convenience.  Some of the dry wares were much better than others.  This tomato powder was definitely one that turned out to be consistently convenient and tasty, and thus worthy of recommending.  We used it when we made stews and soups and it added a flavorful tomato taste to the various broths and stocks.  I would not recommend this product for making tomato soup since its rather costly, and besides, dried soups are easy and cheap for taking along on a hike.  It is best used in enriching the flavor of a soup or stew, whether it be a ready made mix, or one you are making from stock.  It is very rich and surprisingly good.  I took one star off for it is a little costly for only the 2 oz. you get.  But for what its designed for, it is worth the price since you don't use all that much at once.  As I have stated in my other reviews of dried foods like Barry Farm brands, there will always be a core group of consumers that would never give a favorable nod to a powdered food substitute of any kind.  This powder is definitely not going to remind you of the old home days of native tomato's from Grammas back yard for sure.  If you feel you are one of those that never considered a dry substitute of any kind real food, trust me that this is no time to start feeling like Daniel Boone by trying out this powder.

Like those, Miracle Noodles is not going to be exactly pasta, any more than say, spaghetti squash is pasta.<br /><br />It doesn't taste bad, it doesn't taste like anything at all.

You will only taste the flavors of whatever you put on the noodles or whatever you put the noodles into.<br /><br />The texture is rubbery (not as bad as that 'instant jellyfish' I tried from the Asian market, but still rubbery).

The noodles in my two times eating them have tended to stick together so I have to eat them in clumps. I think this may not be the case if I had them in soup though, but I'll be trying that soon.<br /><br />One thing that was immediately apparent after I ate them was that I had a full, satisfied feeling. It made me feel content and as if I had been well fed even though the only substantial calories had come from the sauce I had put on them. I don't really believe they're calorie free completely, so I log them as 3 calories in my diet log. Still, for the way they fill me up for so few calories, they really feel worth it.<br /><br />So if you want something that is a decent substitute for pasta, which may be something of an acquired taste, then this is for you. If you really care about losing weight you will try whatever interesting foods you need to try in order to do it. This is a way to fill up with very few calories.<br /><br />Even if you don't like it, I think using it once a day is a good option to help people lose weight. Even if you don't like it, just eat it anyway and you'll be full and not hungry anymore. That alone is worth the price. If you do like them, then that's a bonus."

He is a Dalmation/Hound mix and has joint issues in his back legs.  At 12 years old we have definitely noticed him slowing down.  He has food allergies so having this medication in the form of duck breast (something which dogs are rarely allergic to I am told) was perfect for our Buddy.  He's running a bit again in the yard and seems more inclined to go for a walk (something he used to love to do).  I highly recommend a try if you are skeptical.  I like it so much I went to a ""subscription"" status to save a little more money.  At roughly $20/month for us, it is well worth the ""investment"" - it just plain made him feel better!"

None of the packaging had any identifying labels--not the manufacturer, not the ingredients, nothing. Just three clear cellophane bags. One of the bags had broken open, and a good third of the gummies were loose in the box. Undaunted, I sampled some of the spilled candy and Did Not Die.<br /><br />The Pros:  These have to be the absolute best gummies I have ever tasted, bar none. They definitely resemble the candies in the Amazon picture, so I assume they ARE the Gustaf's brand. The flavors are delicious and unique, unlike many of the more kid-centric candies on the market. They are not for the weak of teeth, however, possessing a very persistent but satisfying chewiness. I love all of the flavors, although I cannot necessarily identify them. (Pear! There's definitely pear!)<br /><br />The Verdict:  I'd give these five stars were it not for the packaging issues.

We also feed Pumpkin Lickin' Chicken and while they like it, they will leave bits of the chicken about.  The Love Me Tender is all gone, even if they aren't starving.  I've fed it to some foster cats who love it as well, but they seem to leave one particular bit on the plate consistently.<br /><br />It is made in Thailand - which shouldn't be a problem.  I was hesitant at first, I generally only buy my cat food from American produced sources, but I did my research and found that Weruva did their research and Thailand has very good protections to make sure your animals will get safe food - possibly it has more protections than the U.S.  I won't link here but do your research if you are concerned.<br /><br />Opening the packet is easy.  The food is kind of chunky with a lot of gravy, for those of you who have gravy loving cats.  I wish this was around when my cat with kidney failure needed food because I think it would have given me a nice way to get some calories and liquid down her.  Remember, if you are feeding only packets, they usually have fewer calories per ounce than a comparable pate style food.  I generally feed it as a ""Please don't wake me up early asking for food"" treat late at night so I'm happy with the lower calorie content.<br /><br />The only reason I gave this review 4 stars instead of 5 is because it is difficult to get every last bit of product out of the packet.  The food itself is a 5.  The packets have those folds at the bottom so they can stand upright and the food and goo get stuck in there.  I use a spoon to get the last bits out but I feel like I always leave a little in there.  It isn't cheap so I want to get every bit of yumminess out. I also would be open to buying bigger packets."

These chips weigh about half what a bag of good chips cost, for the same money.

I've used this brand several times, and it seems to be pretty consistent in it's effectiveness and quality. The best way I can describe the effect of these tabs is it makes a lemon taste like a lemon ""shake-up"" from a fair/carnival. It does not create a super ""candy-like"" sweetness (which I think would be really weird anyway), there is still a hint of sour behind the sweet taste. Also, they do not last anywhere near an hour, more like 15-20 min., so just be warned, and be ready to taste things immediately after dissolving the pill in your mouth. In my experience, there have been a percentage of people for whom the tabs are not effective, maybe between 5-15% in a group (1-3 people per 20).

A blend of 80% Yukon Blend, an array of Latin American and Indonesian coffees; and, 20% Italian Roast - a blend of Latin American coffees.<br /><br />In the cup the flavor was weak, bold as it smelled it did not seem to have the same score in taste. Light bodyweight with a woody feel to it. The light acidity is topped off with a fruity overtone and bittersweetness.<br /><br />Let me be as bold as to recommend Peet's Arabian Mocha-Java. If you are looking for a Multiblend similar to this, Peet's fixes whatever lacked in Starbuck's Verona. This Mocha-Java is balanced, nutty and smooth. It has excellent acidity, with a slight bite.<br /><br />If you want a closer mix to this than I would mix the Arabian Mocha-Java with Sumatra and you will be very satisfied with its resemblance.<br /><br />There are many coffee drinkers who hate Starbucks because of their corporate culture and popularity. I just like to try anything which looks interesting to me and this caffe Verona is one of the better speciality blends Starbucks has offered.<br /><br />I almost forgot to mention, whole beans always rule .

Serve over rice.<br /><br />The first batch I made was a tad on the watery side, I had used a knife to chop the onions and powdered coconut milk for the cream. I thought it was ok but the rest of the family loved it.<br /><br />Understanding the dish a bit better the second time around I used the food processor for the onion, this gave a more even smooth paste like base. Then I used coconut cream on a 1:1 basis for water. That turned out MUCH thicker and tastier.

These are way more like the noodles you find in instant cup soups. And yes they did have an odor when first opened, but nothing terrible, and it was gone after a few min. of washing them in cold water.<br /><br />Some have said they can't work as a substitute in spaghetti, and maybe that's true if you're expecting an exact replica for a flour based pasta spaghetti dish, but I did try it, and I was happy with the results. I followed the advice of rinsing them then patting them dry, I did 2 packages of them at once. While that was going on, I was boiling water. I am a stickler for calorie counting and portion control nowadays, so I pre-measure and freeze most of what I eat. I had a measured portion of low cal. spaghetti sauce in a ziplock bag I was heating up in the water, but put it in too soon, as the bag broke and I ended up with spaghetti sauced water. So I made use of the accident to flavor the noodles. I boiled some pearl onions in the spaghetti sauced water, then added the noodles. Let that all cook for about 7min then heated up a second pouch of spaghetti sauce. I strained the noodles, put them in a bowl with the onions and now heated sauce and added some diced tomatoes and a couple shots of hot sauce. I wanted the tomatoes to cook a bit so I further nuked the lot for a few min in the microwave. Then topped it with a slice of fat free american cheese. It was actually pretty good. The noodles were on the chewy side, but not in a bad way. And they do soak up whatever you flavor them with. So as long as that part is good, the whole dish should be good. I think with these noodles anything spicy will work best. Which is why I added the hot sauce, something I wouldn't do with reg. pasta. I'll probably try a hot asian dish next.<br />But it's really nice to know I can eat twice the amount of the low cal/carb pasta I have been using which was 175cal a serving, and actually cut the calories of the dish down to basically just the 40cal in the sauce and 25 cal in the cheese!!!"

My other dog isn't quite as strong of a chewer but it usually takes her just around fifteen minutes to eat the whole thing (this review is specific to the Biggest Boodas).

Definitely one of the better interactive toys within it's price range.  The dog is supposed to pull the rope to get the treat out.  Well, my boy bypassed all that and within 20 minutes figured out he just had to tip the bottle to get the treats out.  I put bigger treats in to keep him busy for longer and some pieces I still don't know to this day how he got them out before I got home from work.  My only gripe with this toy, which is something the instructions don't tell you, is that the rope starts to stink after a while.  I cleaned it with dish soap a few time but that was only a temporary fix.  Put the rope in the washer and it frayed and came loose.  I'm now using and old medium width leash that I cut and knotted up on both ends (small enough to still let the treats out but not to have him spill all at once), which will also be easier to wash since I don't have to worry about fraying.

I bought the Star Spinner as well as the paw print shaped toy by this same company and they had a blast from the moment I filled it and set it on the floor! I love that the toys are plastic. So they are much easier to clean (just spray and rinse in the sink, or wipe out with a clorox wipe). Particularly since my corgi prefers soft/moist treats as compared to my dry kibble loving golden. I bought this for roughly $20 at my local canine specialty store, which is far more affordable than the ""name brand"" products. And since I worry about the bacterial growth on the far more expensive wooden models, the easy to clean and disinfect plastic one has been perfect for us. Safety Note: as with ANY dog toy, please supervise your dog while using. Their ""drive"" will be increased while playing with the toy, and with the paw print model with the removable cups, don't let your dog chew on the cups, but redirect him to the treat inside the dish after he pulls out the cup. My golden retriever loves it so much that I now use it to give him his kibble every day! Which is much safer as the bigger dogs tend towards bloat, which can kill your dog. This allows him to have fun while eating tiny amounts of kibble at a time. Win,Win!"

Whenever I make it there is never any left.<br />I do add the optional butter (real butter (unsalted)) to the mix as it adds a better smoothness to the cheese and a nice flavor kick. It is highly recommended that the cheese sauce is made separately. Cook the pasta an extra 2-4 minutes than normal, pre-melt the butter and warm the liquid in the microwave for 30 seconds to a minute (I make it in a batch of 2-3 depending on if the bring over friends). Then add the cheese packs 1 by 1 and mix with a whisk, until smooth.

This product is made with just two ingredients -- macadamias and cashews -- and I can say that this product demonstrates what a healthy, good for you food should taste like.<br /><br />The macadamia cashew butter is easily retrieved from the container. There was some oil separation but after a little stirring, one can take a butter knife and quickly spread the substance on a piece of toast or apple slices. When looking at the butter, you will see little pieces of nuts which makes this product product have some texture. This macadamia cashew butter is not as chunky as most chunky peanut butters; the chunks in this product are much finer. I found the flavor to be very much influenced by the raw cashews and actually considered my jar to be more of a cashew butter than a macadamia butter.<br /><br />It is recommended that this product be refrigerated for a longer life.<br /><br />While not noted explicitly on the product's label, I could see nothing that would contradict my belief that this is a vegan product. There is no milk, honey, eggs or other animal-based substances that go into the formulation of this product. According to the product packaging, this product is ""made in a facility that processes tree nuts and soy, but does not process peanuts, gluten, dairy, cholesterol or GMO's.""  As a side note, if you are allergic to cashews, I have not found one of Artisana's butters to be absent of cashews.<br /><br />Artisana products are delicious and simple in their composition.  Since purchasing the macadamia nut butter, I have sampled the pecan, cashew and walnut butters.  With the exception of the cashew butter, I would buy them all again. For holiday gift giving, I'm definitely going to be packaging several of Artisana's products in gift baskets. They are tasty, natural and unique.<br /><br />This product is made in the United States.<br /><br />A note on another place to buy this product, iherb.com.  I turn to iherb.com with frequency to purchase Artisana products.  Sometimes Amazon has the best price and sometimes iherb.com has the best price.  iherb.com has free shipping over a certain threshold and offers thousands upon thousands of natural and organic food products. If interested in trying iherb, you can use my code LEK375 for a five or ten dollar discount depending on order size.<br /><br />Also, Artisana's nut butters are typically offered in 8 oz and 16 oz containers and price is usually about 8 to 11 dollars a jar with the 8 dollars typical of an 8 oz jar and 11 dollars typical of a 16 oz jar.

I am a quick and easy crockpot kinda girl. I always bake chops, not because baking is healthy but because it's lazy..I don't like standing over a stove thank you very much!<br /><br />What I like about the Shake N Bake is, it added a nice flavor to the chops and didn't dry them out. (my main problem when cooking pork chops..dryness) So it was a pleasant surprise to bite into one and not get the feeling I was eating a brick of sand.<br /><br />I'm also not a health nut, so I can't tell you about calories and the such, but I can tell you this.

For one or two persons, it's a great way to make coffee. I have always used regular<br />grind coffee with a Melitta basket, but the Classique Supreme has changed my mind. Melitta's<br />coffee is ground very finely, almost to a powder consistency, which works better with their<br />drip basket system. I often ran the water through twice with regular grind, but don't need to<br />do so with the Melitta coffee. Whenever I can eliminate a step, I'm happy.<br /><br />This particular Melitta coffee, the Classique Supreme, has a rich flavor compared to the<br />rather ordinary coffees that I've gotten used to. Taken black, it has a smoky, vaguely<br />Espressoesque flavor that I find quite delicious. Adding a little creamer (I use the<br />liquid variety) cuts that flavor considerably. The package directions specify two level<br />teaspoons per six-ounce cup, which I find inadequate; twice that amount is much better.<br />Classique Supreme may be a bit pricey, and there may well be better ""gourmet"" coffees<br />out there, but it works for me, and I certainly would get it again in the future.<br /><br />My only complaint: the package is difficult to open without spilling some contents."

Yeah, I know palm oil is horrible for your heart etc. etc., but THAT is what makes all that fake buttery taste so yummy.

Nowhere on the amazon product page does it tell you where these treats are made, so I searched for the Smokehouse website which claimed that ONLY some of their CHICKEN treats contained chicken from China, but all other products are made in the USA. So, I felt safe in purchasing these duck/sweet potato treats. After opening a bag, and giving them to my dog did I glance at the product origin. Needless to say my dog likes them very much, but I was NOT happy to find PRODUCT OF CHINA on the bag.<br /><br />Boo hiss to amazon for not putting the product origin on the product page, and to Smokehouse for misleading consumers on their product information website. Why do they do this, because there are customers just like me that care where the product originates. Many of you may not be concerned about this, but I am, and I think it's very misleading not to provide accurate, and complete information about the product when purchasing from an internet store. At least the product doesn't smell like plastic like the Dingo products.<br /><br />I won't be purchasing these again. My dog seemed to like them, but she won't be getting anymore of them. I took a star off due to the lack of complete information from amazon, and misleading information from Smokehouse.<br /><br />UPDATE: Big thumbs up to amazon for great customer service. When I called to return this item they were very helpful in processing a refund, and because it is considered a grocery item I didn't even have to return the items. I had also purchased the Smokehouse duck chips, but they too are made in China. I suggested the addition of the country of origin to both product pages.

My three cats loved all four fish flavors and the Chicken Pot Pie but only the one who eats anything would eat the Sesame Chicken. Fortunately Chicken Pot Pie is available separately.<br /><br />Because of concerns about the controversial ingredient menadione sodium bisulfite raised in Joe McBu's review of the fish flavors, I'm  somewhat wary of  this product.  A Google check of ""menadione sodium sulfite in pet food"" shows  there's quite a bit of concern in the blogosphere  and it centers on two factors 1. This ingredient is a cheap and not very effective source of Vitamin K that has not been tested for safety in pets.  2. The FDA  bans it for human consumption due to its associations with kidney/liver damage.  So the question then becomes: might it not also be a factor in why kidney disease is such a common pet killer, especially senior pets (which mine are)?  Consumer concerns seem to be having some impact, as many manufacturers are discontinuing using it. An email questioning its use sent to the Petite Cuisine site over a week ago has not been answered.<br /><br />After losing  a cat to the poisoned Chinese wheat gluten in '07, I switched to Fancy Feast grilled flavors,  the only wet food that was both free from wheat gluten and considered edible by my fussiest cat when laced with his evening meds.  Petite Cuisine is a huge hit with Fitz, probably because it's  even more liquidy than grilled Fancy Feast, which I've just learned also contains menadione.<br /><br />So, what to do?  At the moment I'm dividing one can of Petite Cuisine among the three cats for the evening meal when Fitz gets his meds, supplemented with California Natural or Paul Newman Senior dry food, neither of which contain menadione. Mornings I use wet Wellness (which is much less popular at my house, but menadione-free) instead of Petite Cuisine or Fancy Feast.  For treats, Greenies have been eliminated in favor of  Whole Life Chicken Treats.<br /><br />Meanwhile, I recommend you read Joe McBu's review on the fish pack page."

Adding fresh herbs with the cheese sauce.  It gives a depth to the flavor.  My favorite herb to add (so far) is cilantro (add about 1/3 cup chopped after mixing in the cheese sauce).  Other enjoyable variations were adding 2/3 cup of Italian parsley or 1/8 cup fresh dill leaves."

The taste, however (and let's be honest, here--why else does one eat a cookie?), leaves much to be desired. It's superior to run-of-the-mill hard-baked chocolate chip cookies, but that's not really saying much. As soft-baked cookies go, this one is just mediocre. The chocolate flavor is not especially rich, the almond flavor is so subtle that it's almost undetectable, and the cookie's overall texture and flavor are decidedly bland.

Zipp Fizz claims that it's a natural product and on its website says that it is sweetened with xylitol.  Xylitol is a natural sugar made from the birch tree, and used in Europe for over 100 years.  I use xylitol on a regular basis and agree that if it comes from the right source and not from China, where it's made from corn, it is healthy and has very good side effects such as cavity prevention.  But,on the ingredients list, xylitol is the last ingredient, meaning, that it is the smallest ingredient in the formula.  On the other hand Sucralose (also known as Splenda) is very high on the list of ingredients.  That's where the aftertaste is from.  If you don't care what you put in your body then this is a good product as it does work as advertised.  Why add Splenda if the xylitol is in there? Because the splenda is cheaper. So obviously there is no need for the xylitol other than to use it as a marketing ploy.  They know this and have told me that their new product - immune fizz - has no Splenda.  Why not take it out of the regular zipp fizz too and make it healthier too?  I was sucked into the purchase by the xylitol reference only to find the sucralose in the product.  I wonder what else they aren't saying?"

It's a label often slapped onto an over priced product to attract the those that will eat/drink anything with the word on ""gourmet"" because they think it makes them look cool and hip. And it usually doesn't taste what I would consider ""gourmet."" So, I confess, I started reviewing this with a bias against it - high price and labeled ""gourmet"".<br /><br />With only a ""one pot"" sample to work with, I didn't have a chance to try differing brewing methods. I went with my typical coffee making method, drip brew. It smelled nice, looked pretty dark. The taste is very hard to explain. While it has a full flavor, that flavor is of...weak coffee. I thought I'd botched the brew, but when I compared the color and opacity against my normal stuff, the Puroast looked identical. It just tasted like the same near see through stuff one gets at a greasy spoon restaurant, gas station,IHOP, etc. While not vile, it wasn't for me. I prefer a darker, richer taste.<br /><br />That being said, the big deal about Puroast is that it's low acid. That I will say I definitely noticed. Not even a hint of tummy twisting, even though I intentionally drank it on an empty stomach. For those that have problems with acid, and don't mind (or maybe even like) the taste of weak coffee, it's worth a try at least.

It's not the best oatmeal I've ever had, but it is quite good.  And it is great to see yet another vegan-certified product on the market.  This is a great option for busy vegans (like me!) looking for a quick breakfast.  You can probably make better oatmeal from scratch, but it would take a lot longer.  So, really, this is a good product.<br /><br />But I have two (somewhat related) complaints.<br /><br />First, the serving size is *ridiculously* small.  Each packet of oatmeal is about 120 calories.  That's just silly.  Unless you're a child, or you're planning on eating much more than oatmeal for breakfast (or adding significant quantities of fruit to your oatmeal), you'll want to open a couple of packs each time you sit down.  That's a bit annoying.  (You could solve this one problem by buying the larger cups.  But they're a much worse value, calorie-for-dollar.  And the second problem, below, still applies.)<br /><br />Second, there is so much packaging and unnecessary waste.  It's absurd that ~50 ounces of oatmeal is spread out over six boxes, each of which contains eight microscopic paper bags of oatmeal.<br /><br />These problems could be solved by just selling single-container bags of oatmeal.  The result would be less waste and packaging and an easier time serving.<br /><br />Still, overall, this is a good product."

I jumped at the chance for my dog to give it a try. When this arrived it came in a large bag, I thought this would have been a tiny little bag of treats, it was not,  the treats inside were very large 2-1/4"" long and about 2"" wide and about 1/2' thick. It also had a nice crease in the middle to brak it in half if  you choose to give a smaller treat. As most treats they smell awful but I guess a dog would like that.<br /><br />I gave my dog, a constantly hungry Black Pug, a choice of his frozen treat in one hand and Newman's own in the other, he took a while but chose his treat.<br /><br />I then gave him Newman's own treat and he took it but he sniffed at it for awhile.  Now he knows what it is. I then sat down at my laptop and he jumped up to be with me, he stared at the treat and I moved it toward him and nothing, I gave the OK command and he looked at it,  I had to pick it up and give it too him. Now it is a few minutes later, he is sitting here, the treat is on my leg and he is looking at it, oops just jumped off.<br />My dog, who will eat just about everything, just walked away from this treat.

I tasted no salt whatsoever.  The almonds themselves had a rather bland taste to them.  Perhaps it was the mixing of the two flavors that negated both of them.  Mind you, there was nothing terrible about the taste.  It was just bland.<br /><br />The crunch factor was about the only redeeming quality of these almonds.  Dry roasting provided a very nice loud crunch.  The dark chocolate ""dust"" wasn't messy, but a tiny tad of it did get on my fingers.  It was easily washed off, however, and this really isn't a major concern for me.<br /><br />What has me fence-sitting, though, is the fact that when my wife came home later in the evening, she tried the almonds and fell in love with them.  I was fully prepared to give a two-star rating to these almonds until she gave them such glowing approval.  In the end, I guess that it all boils down to personal taste.

When I got my first real full time job, I would easily drink a pot of coffee every day.  However, as someone with a lot of gastrointestinal issues, coffee is a huge dietary sin.  The caffeine and acid could do me, and spur stomach aches that would last for days.  When I was officially diagnosed with acid reflux, my doctor told me to cut all caffeine out of my diet, cold turkey, until things were under control.<br /><br />Now that I have learned how to control my gastro issues, I am once again worshipping at the shrine of the coffee bean.  Since I began working again, I make a small pot daily.  But I quickly find myself feeling icky from drinking coffee.  So when I learned about Puroast Low Acid Coffee, I was thrilled.  It caters to people who have acid issues but love coffee.  I was thrilled to get to try it.<br /><br />My first impression was WOAH, this coffee is strong.  I am not a huge fan of french roast coffee, I tend to like a milder blend.  Once I got over the initial taste, and adjusted my milk and Splenda accordingly, I started to really enjoy this coffee.  While it was fresh and hot, it was pretty delicious.<br /><br />The problem with this coffee is when I returned to the pot for a second cup.  This was probably within 20-30 minutes of brewing, and the heating unit was still on.  But the coffee did not taste fresh at all; it almost tasted as if I had reheated coffee from yesterday.  It actually tasted more acidic that my normal coffee does.  So, I had to throw the rest of the pot out.  Because of this, I just cannot tell if this coffee really does allow someone with acid issues to enjoy a pot of coffee.<br /><br />Perhaps it was the french roast blend; another blend may have better results.  I would certainly try another flavor, because as I said, the initial cup was fantastic.  If this could be purchased as a resealable container, I may be more likely to purchase it, and make only a cup or two at a time, so as not to waste it.

My one year old daughter has suffered horrible constipation since switching to cow milk on her birthday. After a month of us both suffering (because I had to help it along if you get my drift), I switched her to goat milk. After 2 days, she was passing perfectly soft stools. The goat milk definitely cured her of the constipation, but each can I open seems to be different. Sometimes when I reconsitute it, I know right away that it is going to taste terrible because the smell is so strong. Other cans, I hardly notice it. She will not drink the bad-smelling milk, and when I have tried it, I have nearly vomitted! Majorly salty and gamey tasting.<br />Compared to fresh (Meyenberg from the fridge section of grocery store), well, it really doesn't compare. I have found the fresh to taste sweet, like cream, and then there is a little gamey after-taste, but nothing like the slap-you-in-the-face taste of the powdered. I was hoping to save money with the powdered, but since it is a 50/50 chance she won't drink certain cans, I am really wasting money. I am thinking I will have to stick with the fresh from now on.<br />If anyone has any ideas about what the difference between cans could be, I would love to hear it!

I'm a take it or leave it consumer and in general, I go for the good stuff.  This sample bar was my introduction to the Newman's Own Organic Chocolate line, and in order to get a variety of opinions, I shared this taste with several co-workers.<br /><br />My immediate impression was that the bar had the nice, crisp snap of well-tempered chocolate, and also that it had a lovely texture, melting quickly and smoothly in my mouth.  The ""dark"" chocolate bar has a slightly smoky flavor, but only 54% cocoa, which is less than what many may be looking for in a dark bar.  (Newman's Own also has a super dark bar with 70% cocoa.)  All of us felt that this bar was sweeter than we would have ideally preferred, more akin to bittersweet chocolate than a true dark chocolate.  It was suggested, for that reason, that it might be a nice high-quality bar for baking--though as noted previously, it is not a standard baking bar size.<br /><br />The other thing that all of us noticed was a very subtle orange note to the flavor, to the point that we searched the ingredients for an explanation.  The ingredients of this organic bar are very simple and straightforward.  In fact, there are only five, none of which would explain this undertone.  And it wasn't a problem, overt, or unpleasant; it was simply commented upon.  Further perusing the Newman's Own offerings, I see they produce a dark chocolate orange bar, and I have to suppose there is some minor cross ""contamination"" of the flavors.  Mystery solved.<br /><br />A quick survey among my cohort revealed that there was only one of us who really cared that the product was organic.  Yeah, the rest of us are Philistines.

Generally, Popchips are low in calories, low in fat and relatively low in sodium.  They make an excellent snack that's a lot better for you than regular potato chips.<br /><br />Problem is, the chili lime flavor really isn't very good, in my view.  There's sort of an off-putting aftertaste to them that I can't just put my finger on.  You can taste the lime, although it's a bit stronger than I'd like, and it sort of tastes like bad chili, but I'm not a fan of this variety.<br /><br />Sure, I'll eventually finish the box, but I wouldn't order them again.  So while I love Popchips in general and enthusiastically recommend them, I can't recommend these and give them a 2.5 star rating, which I'll round up to 3 stars mostly because I do like and support Popchips.<br /><br />I'd recommend avoiding these.  The flavor isn't quite right, in my view.  My favorite flavor is barbecue followed by plain and the variety pack is a good way to figure out what you like the best.

When I make my own tea, I just use a piece of ginger about the size of half my thumb, 16 oz. of water, which I boil for 10 minutes and let sit for another 5 and all I add is a teaspoon of brown or raw sugar.  Excellent for sore throats.  Although you can get a similar soothing effect from Gold Kili but for nearly $2 a cup, it will burn a hole in your pocket.  If convenience is the only consideration, then this product is okay.  Otherwise, I'll stick to making my own tea."

They were much larger than I expected, some pieces were much thinner than others. My dog got through most of the ranger rib within 30 minutes. She is still chewing on some of the pieces that have splintered off.<br /><br />The only worry I have is that the splintered pieces are just that. Thin, sharp, oddly shaped pieces. Even the main bulk of the bone after having split was very sharp looking. I would suggest to monitor your dog, especially if you have one that is known to not chew their food very well, or will get in a rush in the presence of another dog and swallow pieces before being well chewed. Swallowing these sharp pieces could be very dangerous and has me monitoring my dog very closely when she chews on these ranger ribs.<br /><br />I previously bought the Merrick GI bones. The bone is much thicker and does not splinter. One bone for her has lasted her (collie/hound mix) for more than a month and she has barely cracked the bone. Other breeds, her roommate the american bulldog/lab mix makes it look easier to crack the GI bone, but she practically devours the ranger rib very quickly.<br /><br />I would consider buying the ranger ribs only on a treat basis. MAYBE once a week if at that. They get eaten up way too fast. Although they are much cheaper than the GI bones, I don't believe they are worth buying if you want a bone that will last."

And if you want organic, that narrows the field considerably.  For us, in an ideal world (with unlimited funds), organic would be nice.  But we happily settle for any good dark chocolate.  This wasn't bad by any stretch of the imagination, but it just did not stand out.<br /><br />What we didn't expect was such a great difference in the chocolate flavor compared to what we usually eat (I'll come to that in a moment).  Our favorite reasonably affordable dark chocolate is 60% cacao.  It's not organic, and doesn't have a star's name attached to it, but it's still considered a good brand.  At just 6% less than what we're used to (54%), both my wife and I were surprised that the chocolate taste didn't just jump out.<br /><br />What we compare to is the San Francisco-based Ghirarxxxxx Chocolate Company's 60% bittersweet chocolate.  While not organic, they at least advertise theirs as ""all natural.""  But we buy it for the taste.  It has a much more prominent dark chocolate flavor.  Newman's Own seemed rather bland to both of us - much more so than we would have expected for 54% vs. 60% cocoa.<br /><br />For some, the issue of cost may also be an issue.  Currently (at the time of this review) the 2.25 oz bar is not available on Amazon, but the 3.5 oz size is available, ranging from $1.33/oz to $2.06/oz, or ranging between roughly $21 - $33 per pound of Newman's Own.  One can go to WMart (they have frequent sales on this) or many grocery stores and pick up an 11.5 oz bag of Ghirarxxxxx Premium Baking Chips, 60% Cacao Bittersweet Chocolate, the same thing as the fancy-packaged squares on the candy aisle at a far higher price, for between $2.50 per bag (on sale) to the upper $3 range per bag.  The key is to look for it in the baking aisle in bags, where the price is far lower than the candy-aisle version.  Even at $3.50/bag, that works out to about $4.90 per pound - a considerable difference from Newman's Own.  Even if Newman's was 1/4 the price shown elsewhere on Amazon for the 3.5 oz size, in order to make it price-competitive with the Ghirarxxxxx 60% dark, we'd go for the latter without hesitation - there's that much difference in taste.  My wife uses the Ghirarxxxxx frequently for baking, and if Newman's Own was competitive in price (and available as chips instead of squares), she'd still get the Ghirarxxxxx.<br /><br />Some reviews complained of a waxy texture with the Newman's Own.  We didn't really find that to be the case.  It melted nicely in our mouths (which we like to do before swallowing it in order to really enjoy the taste) and had what we both considered a nice consistency.  It was simply lacking a strong chocolate taste, though what was there was still decent.  I'd expect (and generally find it to be the case) that a dark chocolate with a high percentage of cocoa would have a fairly strong chocolate taste - much stronger than the namby-pamby taste of milk chocolate (which I used to love, and no longer even enjoy since our switch to dark).<br /><br />Some may say we're comparing apples and oranges (organic vs. non-organic).  Yes, and I realize that's not entirely fair.  But for us, though we buy a lot of organic foods, that isn't the major consideration when it comes to ""recreational"" chocolate (we're really addicted ;)  ).  Taste is the major factor, followed by affordability, and hands down our preferred brand comes out the winner.  I would not anticipate a follow up purchase of Newman's Own in the future, as a result of this sample.<br /><br />But if you've got the money, have to have organic, and want dark chocolate, you probably won't be disappointed with this product - it just isn't a stand-out.  I honestly expected more."

It seems every normal-sized spoonful has 5-6 raisins on average. It's enough to make me look up the health benefits of raisins, as I can't see a cereal this sweet as being very healthy. As suspected, raisins are full of calories, mainly from sugars. If you're looking for a very healthy cereal, look elsewhere. This one seems to be made for those with a sweet tooth, though I guess some may find that sweetness from raisins is better than sweetness from other ingredients (ex. high fructose corn syrup).<br /><br />My rating reflects my personal opinion and taste, more than the quality of the product. Amazon shipped them to me in a shape no worse than found at a local grocery store and the flakes are still very crisp and palette pleasing, with the sell by date 6 months away (Mar '13). It seems fresh enough. It's the ratio of raisins and flakes that bugs me; I guess I was hoping more for a bowl of Wheaties with only a handful of raisins, for 1-2 raisins per spoonful on average.<br /><br />As a warning for those who don't normally eat raisin bran, beware that this cereal is dense. 20 oz of this stuff comes in a similar sized box as some others' 10-14 oz boxes. If you eat a bowl of it, filled up the same amount as you would with something like Cheerios, this will leave you a heavy feeling in your stomach. I recommend mixing some of this cereal with some other cereal, to make it more palatable, with my favorite being Quaker Oatmeal Squares, though I imagine this goes well with many other cereals.<br /><br />Also note that these boxes currently do not have any Kellogg's Family Rewards codes, at least the three I checked do not. Maybe it might be a new program and Amazon still has old stock."

I like it the best out of major brands, either from the local franchise (cream and sugar) or made at home (black).  Dunkin Donuts' coffee is not for everyone, as it has a heavily roasted taste.  At work, we purchase Starbucks Sumatra from the local coffee delivery distributor (it's actually cheaper than DD or other brands!).  Starbucks House Blend used to be what we bought, but everyone in the office (myself included) felt it was one of the most acidic coffees to drink.  Their Sumatra is stronger but less acidic.  I'm no coffee expert, but the last couple years has definitely opened my eyes to the nuances of coffee flavor.  With that experience, I was interested to try this product.<br /><br />The flavor, off the bat, is certainly less acidic.  I drank it black, as I don't typically add anything to my coffee.  It has a fuller coffee taste than many decafs I've tried, but there is a bit of a dull taste to it.  I made it at home, and have a very clean coffee maker, but it was just a little off.  I prefer it to Dunkin decaf, but not by much.  If you require a non-decaf coffee with low acid, this is a fine choice.  It may improve with sugar or creamer too.  There may be better choices out there for this type of product, or coffees which are full flavor but less acidic.  I am not extremely sensitive to the acid content in coffee, but if you are, this should be a good choice for you."

Actually, a supervisor canceled it, then a few minutes later I canceled it (twice); and I was asked to call them back... and the chap on the line that time queried me about if I wanted the order canceled... sigh....<br /><br />I was extremely disappointed...<br /><br />(watch this one get pulled)<br /><br />If you can get the product, at the original price I was quoted on February 3, 2011...

Unfortunately the main two juices used in this drink are Apple and Grape and that left me not tasting the ""Orange Tangerine"" as much as I had wanted.<br /><br />Overall when comparing the two beverages not only did it not impress me with taste or nutrition, but add on the obvious price difference ($.03 per ounce vs. $.11 per ounce) and The Switch won't be causing me to switch.

Eight O'Clock has a bit of that though not bad. However, the beans don't look freshly roasted and don't have a strong aroma when first opening the bag. They look only slightly oily and light brown. Not the dark oily look of fresh Starbucks or Peets beans. I doubled the amount of coffee I usually use to brew and the flavor isn't bad, just not rich and strong.<br /><br />** Update 4/20/10 ** I tried mixing these coffee beans with Starbucks beans. The resulting coffee is a big improvement over Eight O'Clock alone and slightly mellows the Starbucks.<br /><br />** Update 7/2/10 ** I just tried the Italian Dark Roast and found it slightly better, with darker and more oily beans.

As other reviewers have noted, this is not like your typical dry jerky.  It seems more like something that would be created by the company that makes SlimJims or something - it's moist and chewy.  The individual packets don't tear easily, either, despite being notched at the end.  You know how sometimes plastic can tear very cleanly, but sometimes it turns into a ragged edge and becomes a struggle?  That's what happens with these 8 times out of 10.  So if you're out and about (not near a sink) and you try to open it and the tear doesn't work perfectly, you potentially have liquid dripping out onto you, certainly on your fingers as you're trying to get the jerky out of the package and into your mouth.  And the liquid dries sticky.<br /><br />Anyway, as I said, the flavor is good and I've now eaten most of mine, but I have taken to opening the package with scissors and eating them only at home so I can wash my hands afterward."

We've managed to find places where we won't use them often.  The other ""soft white"" bulbs we bought work just fine.  The 30-watt bulbs are especially  bright and nice, but can actually put out too much light in a multibulb fixture and so might need to be mixed with 13 or 23 watt bulbs in that setting.  One other issue is that several of the Earthmate bulbs we received were broken and two were DOA but not broken.

Unappealing taste.,"Yesterday's mail brought from amazon.com's VINE program a free 3-ounce sample of PUROAST LOW ACID COFFEE, Dark French Roast.<br /><br />My wife and I tried it before, during and after breakfast this morning (2 mugs apiece so far).<br /><br />-- (1) How I prepared the coffee drink.<br /><br />My wife and I had had a late dinner yesterday evening at the monthly meeting of Asheville-Blue Ridge Torch Club in a first class local Hotel. In my case my main course was a stew based around a fatty cut of short ribs of beef. When I woke this morning, I fet mild stomach discomfort, and first reached for a GAVISCON-brand  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001G7QR76"">Gaviscon Extra Strength Chewable Antacid Tablets, Original Flavor, 100-Count Bottles (Pack of 2)</a> stomach soother. An hour our so later my wife and I began sampling the PUROAST Low Acid Coffee. I prepared the drink  in in our MR COFFEE-brand drip coffee maker. I decided to do it exactly as I normally do with FOLGER's or other brands, aiming at ten cups of coffee based on three scoops of the ground beans. Those three scoops used up about 3/5 of the contents of our free sample. I will try the rest tomorrow.<br /><br /> And here are the agreed opinions of us both:<br /><br />-- (2) PUROAST coffee felt very soothing in the stomach - immediately. Here was something better than any other coffee we had ever tried. Here, a couple of hours later, I am still grateful for a sense that PUROAST soothed my agitated innards. This is a quality to build the brand around, no doubt.<br /><br />-- (3) Neither wife nor I found the taste pleasant. It was far from vile. We didn't feel compelled to stop drinking. As I write, I am still sipping my second mug. I am no expert on evaluating coffees, but if I put my mind to it I could probably describe five different flavor sensations. My wife and I discussed our sensations.<br /><br />First, I asked her: ""Does this remind you of POSTUM <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005DGQK1Y"">1904 Vintage Ad Postum Coffee Substitute Caffeine Free - Original Print Ad</a>? -- a drink I don't like. She: POSTUM tastes better. To me the underlying flavor reminds of POSTUM, a very STRONG POSTUM.<br /><br />Second, it tasted bitter in the mouth, though felt soothing in the stomach.<br /><br />Third, something reminds of wood shaving being turned into charcoal.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: My wife and I are both tempted to explore further the concept of ""low acid coffee"" and to order other varieties from the company's website:<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />We are keeping an open mind. In my case I hope to find another blend that reminds me a bit more of coffee and a bit less of POSTUM.<br /><br />-OOO-"

42917,B002NHYQAS,A2DSXA1E02C86D,Joseph Haschka,0,1,3,1299542400,Is there such a thing as bad chocolate?,"Some might argue that, just as there's no such thing as bad sex, there's no such thing as bad chocolate. (Even the worst of the latter I've ever consumed - in Leningrad, Russia in 1984 - was still edible. My history with the former we needn't discuss.)<br /><br />So, here we have NEWMAN'S OWN ORGANICS DARK CHOCOLATE (NOODC). Mind you, it doesn't contain such poncy embellishments such as almonds, macadamia nuts, cherries, pomegranate, mint chips, bacon shreds, rice krispies, orange peel, caramel filling, peanut butter, raisins, walnut pieces, toffee crunch, coconut, red pepper, coffee beans, cranberries, blueberries, white chocolate chunks, or the kitchen sink. It's just 100% chocolate, i.e. evaporated cane juice, chocolate liquor, cocoa butter, soy lecithin, and vanilla - all organic, of course. (It must be pointed out, however, that vanilla is used by chocolate makers to mask the flavor of imperfectly roasted cocoa beans. Hmm.)<br /><br />At 54% cocoa, NOODC isn't particularly elevated on that scale. Who in a chocolate company determines the what and why of an optimum concentration, I wonder? Probably the (cocoa) bean counters, I imagine.<br /><br />Because I have a taste disorder described more fully in my review of the book <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0618861882"">Remembering Smell: A Memoir of Losing--and Discovering--the Primal Sense</a>, I can't judge the sweetness of this candy, but only the chocolate flavor and the ""mouth feel."" Both are pretty much average and acceptable. Is it better than one of my favorite brands, a <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004CH40HQ"">Cadbury Royal Dark Chocolate Bar, 3.5 oz, 24 count</a> bar? Uh ... no. But, it's infinitely better than that Commie chocolate eaten back in the nostalgic good old days of the Cold War! I mean, without any of the added embellishments mentioned above, a plain chocolate bar has to work overtime to stand out from the rest of that genre on the shelf.<br /><br />Actually, I was more interested in the subtleties of the label. Paul himself is pictured with Nell, his daughter by Joanne Woodward. Nell started the Organics Division of Newman's Own in 1993, and remained at its head when it chipped-off the old block in 2001. Dad still lent his support, though, before he died. I gather it's Nell`s leadership and participation that's inferred in the confectionary's subtitle, ""The Second Generation.""<br /><br />Again, according to the labeling, the cocoa has been certified by the ""Rainforest Alliance."" Perhaps I'm being cynical, but it makes me wonder how much Nell's company tips this outfit for the granting of its certification, however legitimate such a ritual blessing may be. Similarly, there's the notation ""Certified Organic by Oregon Tilth"" - whatever a ""Tilth"" is.<br /><br />Also, there's the usual CYA disclaimer: ""Manufactured on equipment that may process products containing peanuts, other nuts, milk powder, wheat soy, and egg."" The potential hazards for allergy sufferers aside, how might those possible contaminants affect the organic quality of NOODC if they themselves aren't organic? Inquiring minds want to know. (Perhaps the ""USDA Organic"" sticker carries implications here. I'll certainly sleep better at night knowing the guv'mint is involved.)<br /><br />And the fact that a 1 bar serving size contains only 5 mg of sodium means that my wife could chow down the whole thing - minus the single bite I was tossed - without fear of elevating her already borderline-high blood pressure. After all, dark chocolate is reportedly a health food.<br /><br />Would I buy NOODC on at the local chain supermarket without it being at a bargain, club price? Probably not. I've never been convinced that ""organic"" isn't mostly a marketing ploy to raise the sticker, and NOODC at full price doesn't give more satisfaction than a less expensive bar laden with assorted impurities, toxins, and carcinogens. And both go down equally well with a glass of cold, non-fat moo."

If this were one of my options at, e.g., the Medusa-esque soda dispensers found at 7-11, I would definitely indulge occasionally and buy some.<br /><br />But an indulgence it is... and that's why I'm not planning on purchasing more from Amazon.  In particular:<br /><br />-- You're paying nearly a buck a can for a little more than a cup of soda.  Please.  I don't mind paying more for higher-quality goods, but at least make it a decent value for the money... make it 12oz.<br />-- Calorically it's not a great value, having around half-again as many calories per once as Coca Cola does.

My well mannered collie mix needed company while I ran errands so we adopted a brother for him.  And this husky mix brother needed something ELSE to keep him from destroying my house (they aren't crated.... we tried with the husky but he escaped out of several different crates).  These toys, along with a peanut butter filled kong, are magnificent at distracting them while I'm away.<br /><br />The tug-a-jug is my least favorite.  It is difficult to fill-- filling is easy enough but kibble tends to dribble out as you TRY AND TRY AND TRY to match the threads and close the toy back up.  I can't emphasize how frustrating it is to close up this toy!!!<br /><br />My dogs, while very rough with each other, are not rough on toys inside.  They tend to be mellow.  This toy seems to require a dog who is eager to thrash and bash the toy.  I think my dogs might be more inclined to shake it had I bought the small size.  The med/lg is VERY big.  My dogs are BIG.  Not st. bernard big-- but my husky mix is my tallest dog at 60lbs (frame size is that of my old 95lb malamute, he's just a year old and hasn't filled out yet!) and my golden collie mix is 75 lbs and on the large side for a golden retriever.  Also, it holds LOTS of food.  Since the kibble in the toy is a supplement to their meals I only put a half a cup in it.  I haven't measured how much it holds but it must hold upwards of 3 or 4 cups.  When it is filled less the dog must work MUCH harder to get the kibble out.  I only use this toy when I plan to be away from home for more than 3hrs.<br /><br />They DO manage to empty them by carrying them upside down-- and really only the husky has a large enough mouth to manage this.  They kick some out of it as they would their treat-ball.  It takes them forever which suits my purpose of distracting them from my absence.<br /><br />All in all, it is well constructed.  My dogs would never be able to open this.  If your dog likes to shake his toys like a wolf and his prey this toy might be a wonderful choice.  If your dogs save rough play for outdoors and you plan to provide this as an indoor diversion you MIGHT want to look elsewhere.  And keep in mind the large scale this toy is made on!!"

No mistake should be made to think that Switch is primarily a fruit drink.  Although it contains 100% juice, Switch is a soda first and a fruit beverage second.  The carbonation, combined with the various citrus flavors, make Switch taste a bit like Mountain Dew with an extra orange kick.<br /><br />Soda fans who like Mountain Dew but want something made of juice should love Switch, as it does offer a slightly healthier alternative to the standard carbonated drink.  Since there are so many fruit juices present each can has 100% of the daily recommended Vitamin C and 20% of the daily recommended vitamin A.  The lack of artificial preservatives does also give it a slightly more crisp taste.<br /><br />It's important to note that Switch isn't ""sugar free,"" but rather has ""no sugar added.""  The distinction is missed by many, and could be very important for diabetics or anyone watching their sugar intake.  The drink actually has 34 grams of sugar in each can, but since it's coming from the fruit juice and not from high fructose corn syrup it's less of a problem for anyone looking for a more healthy drink.<br /><br />The biggest factor in deciding if Switch will be worthy anyone's time depends entirely on how much they enjoy carbonated citrus drinks.  Soda fans who want a fruitier and less artificial drink will probably love Switch.  People who just want fruit juice and don't enjoy the carbonated flavor should probably avoid, however."

Now obviously 54% cacao isn't going to register on the palate like 70%, 75% or 90% cacao, but there can still be that ""snap"" to chocolate, which is often compared to notes in coffee or chili pepper, even at the lower percentages.  I can still, for example, perceive that note in many grocery store brand chocolate morsels, although the overall quality of those will not match the Newman's.  By comparison, the Newman's has a waxiness that reminds me of Dove or Cadbury's.<br /><br />I will say that this is probably a safe choice for company, where a little something sweet is desired that won't be too much for less-than-diehard fans of the dark stuff.

Each bite is far too large for an ordinary house cat, and the directions say ""Treat your pet with 1 to 2 Boost Bites per day per 20 lb of body weight.""  My cat weighs much less than 20 pounds, so I cut one of these up into quarters.<br /><br />Well, I tried, anyway.  They don't cut, they crumble.  They seem to have a texture like a fibrous insulation I'd used for soundproofing.  I picked a piece out of the crumbs and dust and fed it to my cat.  He swatted at it a few times then swallowed it whole, even though it was twice as large as his usual treats, which he normally chews.  He wasn't interested in more.  I scooped together a pile of crumbs, added a couple of drops of water, and molded them into a lump.  Wet, he loved it, first chewing up the lump then snuffling up the escaped crumbs.  Right now he's trying to convince me that more testing is needed.<br /><br />The packaging hints at mysterious and wonderful benefits, but I'm a bit doubtful.  It suggests:<br /><br />""Instinct Raw Boost Bites may help promote:<br />*Vitality & energy<br />*Digestive health<br />*Lean muscles<br />Give your pets Instinct Raw Boost Bites and boost their health with the purity of raw food.""<br /><br />The raw ingredients, after chicken and turkey parts, include fruits, ground chicken bone, butternut squash, montmorillonite clay, lettuce and spinach, and dried kelp and sprouts, among other things.

It doesn't really taste like Pho, but it's pretty good WITH some work.<br /><br />Eating this stuff right out of the box is a sure letdown for any person who desires something that actually tastes like Pho. I adore two things about Annie Chun noodle bowls, and that's the dehydrated vegetables and noodles. The veges rehydrate and look/taste like somewhat fresh veges, which is a feat on its own. The noodles are thick and chewy, which I enjoy. However... they just don't belong in pho. The noodles are totally uncharacteristic of real pho, and the veges are missing some important flavors (namely cilantro). On top of all that, the sauce to make the broth really tastes nothing like pho broth. I searched and searched for that cinnamon and star anise that you generally taste in real pho, and it's just not there.<br /><br />On the plus side, it's pretty easy to soup this up (pun fully intended). To get this to taste like a halfway decent bowl of pho like I'm used to, I add a few things. First and foremost, a hefty amount of sriracha sauce (I like my pho's broth to be a rich red, very spicy, but delicious). I also take some steak and slice it very thinly, layer it on the bottom of the bowl, and pour the boiling water over it and allow it to sit for 3-4 mins to get a nice med-rare cut of meat in there. While that's sitting, I dice up a good amount of cilantro and toss that in, along with a good handful of bean sprouts. Once that's all in, I put in a pinch of sugar (the sauce has a sour aftertaste if you don't), and then I eat. Sounds like a lot of work, but it takes me about 15 minutes to make a very filling bowl of ""pho"". It still isn't quite there as the broth is missing some complex flavors, but it's actually not bad. I would give it 4-4.5 stars after said additions are done."

They're made of potato, use sunflower and safflower oils and the seasoning even has everything I can pronounce.  Although I am always suspicious when the designation ""spices"" is used without spelling out what those spices are.  And there was some rice flour in the mix which explains the aftertaste, but it was the last ingredient in the listing, meaning there shouldn't have been too much.  But I could still taste it.<br /><br />.8 oz is 100 calories for these chips, and it's a fair serving of the chips.  Enough for a small snack.  The bag boasts that they are all natural, and they are gluten free.  And there's no preservatives.  Sodium is about 7% of the daily value, which isn't outrageously high either.  All in all, they aren't extremely great for a person on a diet, but they aren't the worst thing you can eat, especially if you want a bag of chips.<br /><br />Maybe with a different flavor if they eliminated the rice flour I could bring myself to eat these again.  But since for now it's still there, I'll be steering clear.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012"

Also, before the espresso starts coming out of the machine, the capsule makes a bit of a popping. Both of these issues are addressed on ECC's website, where they try to assure customers that this is normal and should not cause any concern.<br /><br />So, on to this particular variety, the Espressivo.  I'm a little surprised by the other reviews posted so far.  Unless the design of the CitiZ changed drastically, I'm not sure why one of the other reviewers was unable to use the ECC capsule.  As to the flavor, while I agree with the other reviewer so far that it isn't as good as Nespresso's darker roasts, I'm not in agreement that it's nothing more than bad drip coffee.  I actually think the Espressivo ECC capsule tastes okay -- definitely stronger than drip coffee -- and in my CitiZ it produced as much crema as a Nespresso capsule.  Unfortunately, however, the flavor seems kind of ""one note"" compared to my favorite Nespresso capsules.  Given that the cost of the ECC capsules on Amazon isn't that much less than Nespresso capsules available through the Nespresso club (about a 12% cost savings), one has to factor in the ""green"" factor of the ECC capsules to help them decide which capsule to choose.  While I personally feel a lot better about being able to compost the ECC capsules, I also want the best possible flavor from my CitiZ -- that's why I bought it instead of a much less expensive espresso machine.  I'm afraid that unless another variety of the ECC capsules is more to my liking, I'll be sticking with the Nespresso capsules."

May be it is more convenient and more profitable for the company but I would not be surprised if somebody sue Dilmah (or Amazon? or ""middle-man"" unitybrandsgroup.com?) for the false advertising since there is no any single mention in the web-site or  on the package that this is CTC tea, and not loose leaf as boldly stated everywhere. Secondly, regarding the taste, there is no resemblance with that exceptional ""mid 1990th"" Dilmah.

Those who prefer a strong, dark cup of coffee (even at the larger mug setting) should try that brand.<br /><br />Previously, I had found the dark-roast Green Mountain coffees rather boring, but Revv lives up to the hype, both in strength and flavor. Another great Green Mountain coffee is their Espresso Blend (though Amazon doesn't stock it, so the prices tend to be higher here than in brick-and-mortar stores such as Bed Bath and Beyond).

Ritchey,8,9,3,1299801600,I've Had Better but Not in Sugar-Free,"My local grocery store only carries the vanilla Torani syrup in the sugar-free version, and so I decided to order the variety pack from Amazon to see what I thought of their other flavors.  I try to limit my sugar intake, so that's why I was so keen to get a variety of sugar-free ones.  Interestingly, I found that the different flavors do better in different types of drinks.<br /><br />Vanilla - This is still hands down one of the most versatile flavors. I add it to carbonated water and make my own creme soda. It also does well in hot chocolate and coffee, and I've also added it to baking recipes when I've been in a pinch and out of vanilla extract.<br /><br />Raspberry - I'm not usually a huge fan of artificial raspberry flavors, and I don't like this one in coffee or hot chocolate, but it is absolutely wonderful in iced tea! Who knew? I was prepared to donate this one to the office coffee stash, but on a whim added it to my iced tea when I was out of Splenda, and wow, it's very good and seems to lose the funky aftertaste in the tea.<br /><br />Caramel - I'm not overly impressed with this one, but it does work well in adding to my oatmeal in the morning to liven up the plain oats. It tastes even better with a dash of cinnamon, but I don't use this one in drinks because it just tastes kind of odd. It's almost like they couldn't decide between caramel, butterscotch and some other random flavor and kind of went with the middle ground.  I wouldn't order this flavor by itself.<br /><br />Chocolate - This is another one that I've added to my oatmeal at breakfast and have been happy with the result.  This one also works with coffee, but not tea.<br /><br />Irish Creme - I'm a big Irish Creme fan usually, but this one is just kind of so-so.  I do like it in a glass of hot milk for a steamer, and it's okay in hot chocolate, but tastes weird in coffee.<br /><br />Hazelnut - This is a good one for coffee, hot chocolate and oatmeal.  I combine it with the Chocolate one in the oatmeal and it tastes kind of like a Ferrero Rocher, and makes my daily breakfast feel like a bit more of an indulgence than it really is.<br /><br />I ordered the Variety Pack on the Subscribe and Save 4 month rotation, and had to go in and cancel the second shipment because I'm only about halfway through the bottles. It's a toss up as to whether or not I'll completely cancel the subscription because these are sugar-free and it's so hard to find flavor additions that don't come laden down with teaspoons of sugar.<br /><br />Amazon - it would be wonderful if you could offer a make your own variety pack of the Sugar-free syrups! I've seen other Torani sugar-free choices, but I don't want to make the commitment to a 6 pack of a single flavor. I'd definitely order a lot more of these syrups if I could mix up the Variety pack to be more than just these 6 flavors."

Bruegie mostly only likes wet food especially tuna (Sheba Tuna entr&eacute;e is her favorite)...oh, and cheese; we call her the cheese-monger. Banjo mostly likes dry food; he has become carbo-kittie...he begs for bread and crackers.<br /><br />Now that the intended consumers have been introduced, here's their review: Eh, I'm bored.<br /><br />When I looked at the can, I was overjoyed. No wheat gluten and all natural ingredients plus a few vitamins. When I opened the first can, I was even happier; Bruegie likes the foods with more liquid in them and these are fish chunks and lots of liquid. However, when I set the plates down, they were ignored. When it was time for clean-up, most of the food was still there. We have now gone through every flavour in the box...with the same result.<br /><br />The first time we set down a can of Sheba (which wasn't too long ago) Bruegie was all over it and Banjo tried to muscle in. When we are feeding her something she can tell is her favorite (from the smell when we open the can, I suppose,) Bruegie will beg...none of that.<br /><br />All that said, as any cat owner will tell you, EVERY cat is different... and next week, we might be looking at clean plates, but for now the Capehart-Stephenson Kitties are having none of this. The three stars are for the ingredients, hopefully your cats will like it more than ours."

If you prefer smoother over grittier, then try this one (but I hope you try them both to make your own comparison.)<br /><br />**Update 25/10/12<br /><br />I wanted to say that it would have to be the inulin. I was looking at the ingredients in a raw meal powder that I used to take and it has guar gum, and I never experienced gum or tooth pain with it.<br /><br />ALSO, in regards to how horrible the super berry flavor tastes: I tried it with apple juice today and it redeemed itself. I was trying to finish off the container that I still have and normally I mix my Manitoba hemp with water or apple juice and tried it with the super berry Nutiva. It actually tastes very good with apple juice -- they compliment eachother perfectly. I used soy and 7 grain milks before, so I would just recommend trying super berry with juice if you also think it tastes bad."

Now, please tell me how a can that is SO badly damaged, packed in the middle of a case, can go unnoticed by the person who is packing the case???  Or, are you that big a company that you have automation packing these cases, and it is just a strange coincidence that the only dented can ended up EXACTLY in the middle? I feel the can was placed there intentionally so that I would not notice, nor would Amazon (the shipper), no matter what side of the case it was viewed from.  Folks, we are not stupid, and we will get to that middle can eventually, so you are not hiding anything.  As the end user of this product, I feel that this can of pumpkin should have been caught at packaging and thrown in the trash...just as I have to do.  It's all about quality control.  This has raised the price per can by about .25 cents.  That means that instead of me paying $2.36 per can, I have now paid over $2.60 per can.  You have a great product, but I have a problem with a company who tries to pull the pumpkin over it's customer's eyes. Pumpkin is WAY to hard to come by right now and I was happy to have found your product on Amazon.  But, it has turned out to not be such a deal when I have to even throw away one can of pumpkin.  I give you a five star rating for your pureed pumpkin, but I deducted two stars for the wasted can."

My problem is with the marketing, which attempts to justify an inflated price with a dissertation of a long list of purported benefits. Problem is, most if not all of these benefits apply to all brands of sardines, not just these.<br /><br />One thing I'll say at the outset: If BPA free packaging is your most important purchase criterion read no further and buy these now. The packaging is indeed BPA free.<br /><br />But what about the whole concept of ""wild"" sardines? I'm not aware that the sardine has been domesticated, and the lowly pilchards that swarm the seas in massive schools sometimes visible from outer space are not amenable to aquaculture.<br /><br />On the other hand, qualifying these sardines as wild, notwithstanding the fact that all sardines are wild, does confer a seemingly significant though clearly misplaced credibility. No doubt this will boost sales to a gullible buying public.<br /><br />Read the packaging for these sardines and you can't help but feel you're saving Mother Earth as you chomp on your sandwich. But digging down beneath the surface, there's not so much to be excited about.<br /><br />For instance there's the matter of what happens to these fish after they're ""sustainably caught along the California coast"". The small print provides a clue in that these bad boys are ""processed in Viet Nam"". So what's really going on is that our diminutive sardines take on a heavy carbon footprint, travelling as they do from the west coast to the far east and back again, presumably to harvest the otherwise mutually exclusive benefits of buy-local chic and low labor costs. Nonetheless, we read that, ""These sardines are considered a `Best Choice for Sustainability' by a consensus of environmental organizations"".<br /><br />There are other issues as well.<br /><br />The health benefits of chowing down on this product are highly touted. For instance, ""Ounce for ounce, Wild Planet sardines provide 3 times more calcium and phosphorus than milk..."". OK, fair enough. But is this, as implied, unique to the Wild Planet variety only, or is it once again a characteristic of all sardines? Unfortunately, it's the latter.<br /><br />We also learn that these ""delicious meaty portions"" are ""cleaned and scaled"". Buyer beware: this is quite different from ""skinless and boneless"". ""Cleaned"" in this context must mean something other that what is commonly expected by the use of this word in conjunction with fish. Be prepared to either eat the vertebral column and various entrails, or to remove (clean) them yourself.<br /><br />How do they taste?<br /><br />Not bad, if you're into schmaltz herring. These babies are smoked and have a characteristic smoky, salty taste.<br /><br />But don't worry. It's not just any smoke, but ""aqueous natural smoke"" that they're treated with..."

It's really not bad at all, like a very reasonable cocoa.  It's so sweet that it tastes a little like a really high end milk chocolate at first, with a good finish for a milk chocolate.  All in all, for a dark chocolate this is better than Dove (less ""smooth"" because it's grainier, but definitely a better finish), but can't hold a candle to a good high end dark chocolate like Lindt.<br /><br />In terms of organic chocolates, Green & Black makes a darker, smoother, better finishing chocolate, and the bars are bigger, too."

But the fact that it can be cut with scissors might give you a clue as to the constitution of the rubber rope.  Also, the plastic jug is fairly durable, but in her frustration to get at the kibble inside, Roxy has done a little damage to the plastic, making it hard to screw the lid back on straight.

Wind,187,216,3,1325808000,Why can't anyone make a hot cocoa without sucralose/Splenda in it?,"I HATE SUCRALOSE.<br /><br />Honestly, I don't know how other people CAN'T taste it when it's in sweetened products. It's got this unpleasant fake flavor that I just can't ignore. I think any company that uses that junk should be required by law to indicate it on their box and all advertising.<br /><br />That being said, it seems like this hot cocoa has less sucralose than the Cafe Escapes Hot Cocoa, and as such I have to give it higher marks than the competition.<br /><br />Still, I can't believe this product AND its nearest competitor use sucralose but don't say they're a diet, lite, low-sugar, or otherwise unnaturally-sweetened product. It's frustrating. I can taste the stuff, and I really dislike it. I also don't like the chemical makeup of sucralose, but I won't go into that here (just believe me: natural sugar is way better for you in the long run).<br /><br />There's one other choice out there for a hot cocoa in a K-Cup, and that's Swiss Miss. Unfortunately, the Swiss Miss K-Cups are ridiculously high priced and hard to find.<br /><br />My opinion? It's probably better if you just get your favorite hot cocoa in packets, and use the hot water function of your Keurig. It's not worth the K-Cup convenience if you have to put up with artificial sweeteners or significantly higher prices. Spending more than seventy-five cents per cup of water-based hot cocoa is about the limit for me.<br /><br />So, if you're into sucralose/Splenda, then by all means grab this and enjoy that weird aftertaste and decidedly not-sugar flavor. If you're like me, though, and can't stand that artificial stuff, then avoid this product and find another option.<br /><br />Three stars for tasting decent despite the awful artificial sweetener. Minus two stars for being artificially sweetened and not mentioning it anywhere.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I just found out that the Swiss Miss K-Cups also use sucralose. So really, your only choice is to get packets and use your Keurig as a hot water dispenser. How disappointing.<br /><br />UPDATE 02/12: After some research, I found that there is one K-Cup hot cocoa that doesn't have sucralose; However, it is loaded with fructose instead (not the greatest trade-off, since it tastes different from sugar/sucrose, in my opinion) and has no actual sugar/sucrose in it. That one is Green Mountain Coffee Hot Cocoa. Unfortunately, reviews of it say it has a strong coconut flavor (probably because the second ingredient is coconut oil) and is on the salty side, so I have avoided it. It's also more expensive per-cup, and unless you think a single cup of cocoa is worth over a dollar and twenty-five cents (as opposed to a box of 12 packets being around two dollars) then go ahead and try it. I will refrain at this point and stick to using packets.<br /><br />I would also like to clarify again that despite what some comments say, the Cafe Escapes Hot Cocoa K-Cups, Swiss Miss Hot Cocoa K-Cups, and Grove Square Hot Cocoa K-Cups ALL use sucralose. Yes, there is sugar in some of those, but it is IN ADDITION TO sucralose/Splenda, and not by itself.<br /><br />So your choices right now are pure sucralose, sucralose plus a sugar, or pure fructose. None of them is appetizing to me, and all of them make the cost per cup of cocoa quite unpleasant.<br /><br />43 servings of sugar-sweetened cocoa in a canister will run you around six bucks, and it's no more complicated than a K-Cup if you know how to operate a spoon."

Batten,0,1,3,1341446400,Anyone remember dissecting owl pellets in grade-school?,"That was my first impression of these treats out of the bag...  dried up owl pellets (yick).  Not that appearances matter all that much if your pet loves the taste but these are big treats and for my small sized dog, that meant I had to break it apart with my hands which was a touch bit unpleasant for moi.<br /><br />As for my dog, he simply didn't care for these at all.  I really wanted him to like them since he turns his nose up to nearly every treat imaginable (including bits of people food, which I don't consider a bad thing) and I'm always looking for ways to create a little variety for him.  Aside from his dog food, the only treats I've found he likes are the soft/chewy Buddy Treats in chicken flavor and dried chicken cutlets (kind of like chicken jerky) which I stopped giving him after an incident last year where he nearly choked on one.<br /><br />I thought these might have been a good replacement for the dried chicken cutlets that he liked so much because I assumed that these would primarily contain one ingredient (chicken) that had been formed into easier to chew treats.  Of course, this is in part my fault for making such an assumption but I'd like to point out there wasn't and currently isn't an ingredient listing available on this product.  The closest reference to what these treats contain are in the following descriptions ""Your dog's instinctive nature is to eat more meat, poultry, or fish protein and less grain... Instinct Raw Boost Bites are grain-free and gluten-free - perfect for satisfying your dog's carnivorous cravings and nutritional needs...  Raw Boost Bites are a pure and healthy treat made from minimally processed, freeze dried raw ingredients...""  For those of you who may be interested, here is the actual ingredient listing in order as they appear:<br /><br />INGREDIENTS<br />Chicken, Turkey, Turkey Liver, Turkey Heart, Pumpkinseeds, Apples, Carrots, Ground Chicken Bone, Butternut Squash, Ground Flaxseeds, Montmorillonite Clay, Broccoli, Lettuce, Spinach, Dried Kelp, Apple Cider Vinegar, Parsley, Honey, Salmon Oil, Olive Oil, Mixed Tocopherols with Citric Acid (a natural preservative), Rosemary, Blueberries, Alfalfa Sprouts, Persimmons, Inulin, Sage, Clove.<br /><br />Looks like they're really trying to appeal to a 'natural/holistic' audience and I for one am okay with that - in fact, I try and avoid treats for my dog (and myself!) that contain ingredients I don't know to be 'real' however... had I known these to be the ingredients up front, I'd probably have passed knowing that my dog already turns his nose up to the following food items (turkey, apples, carrots, broccoli, lettuce, spinach, blueberries or persimmons).  There are also quite a few ingredients that I never thought about seeing if my dog would enjoy as well as a few 'questionable to me' ingredients (cloves??)<br /><br />I gave this at least three stars because the ingredient list isn't bad per se, but they should update their product description to include this information and although my dog didn't care for them and I couldn't coax him into a second bite - he did manage to eat a first bite after lots of encouragement.  That's a pretty big deal coming from a dog with as fickle a palate as his."

I probably could overlook that if Switch was really, really delicious, but frankly it's not.  The orange-tangerine blend lacks the zip and character of those citrus fruits, particularly tangerine and its delicate sweetness.<br /><br />Instead, there's a heavy taste of the apple-grape combination of juices that forms the fruit base.  There's no added sugar, no high fructose corn syrup or any other sweeteners save the apple and grape concentrates, and that's fine, I'd prefer my juice to not have added sweeteners.  In my opinion, juice doesn't need to be sweetened.  I suspect that the fruit concentrate combo is cheaper than making the drink out of pure citrus juice, so I wonder why it's as expensive as it is.<br /><br />What makes me scratch my head is the notation ""Contains soy.""  What?  Why?  Why on earth put soy in a fruit juice cooler?  Honestly, I'd buy some seltzer or carbonated water of some sort and mix it with my own fruit juice before I'd buy Switch.

I did find it on the weak side after the initial velvety taste went over the tongue. The flavor was rather bland. There was no over-all deep, full-bodied taste, but with the beans adjusted to exclude acidity, I didn't think there would be.<br /><br />I would drink it again, but probably wouldn't buy it.

They are also kosher, gluten-free and vegan.<br /><br />Instead of baking the flavor into the chip, Popchips add seasoning once the chips are ""popped"" (as opposed to fried or baked). This, however, is also the cause of my problem with the chips. I found the flavor to be wildly inconsisent from bag to bag, and sometimes from chip to chip within the same bag. One bag's lime flavor was so overpowering I almost gagged, while the next was a nice, uneventful snack. The lime flavor is also much, much more noticeable than the chili flavor.<br /><br />As a healthy alternative to potato chips, these are a viable option, but keep a glass of water handy - with the almost-randomized flavor intensity, you're not going to know how intense the lime flavor is going to be until you open the bag."

The Wilton stuff is like rubber and hard to roll out thin enough. I had no trouble with this. It also was not too sticky which was the problem I ran into when I used the Duff product from Michaels. So far this is the best fondant I have used. It really doesn't dry out so if you want your pieces to stiffen up quickly or become completely hard you will need to mix in gumtex, tylose or gumpaste to accomplish that. I love the taste of this fondant too, I don't usually like fondant icings but this one is really good! The white is truely white too, not cream or antique at all so you can easily mix in other colors to tint the color you want.<br /><br />UPDATE 1/6/12<br />Lowering my stars from 5 to 3...<br />My first few batches of Fondarific were great, easy to work with, good taste, nice consistency etc. I use alot of fondant and have pretty much used every brand out there plus made my own. I was totally sold on Fondarific until my last couple of orders. I didn't feel like dying fondant so I purchased the colored Fondarific for the first time(Pink and Red) so I'm not sure if that was the problem but they were REALLY soft. Like another reviewer I ended spending an extra 3 hours or so to cover my cake and decorate it because I had to keep putting the stuff in the freezer and it tore and bubbled all over the place. It was ridiculous like working with melting taffy. I live in Washington state and it was October so humidity was definitely not the problem. My last batch of white was workable but also stickier than usual so pieces kept sticking to the mat (even with cornstarch or shortening). So far both batches of black that I purchased were great and didn't have these issues. I have to agree with other reviewers here that the consistancy is lacking with this product. If you get a good batch it is the BEST stuff out there but you have to cross your fingers and hope luck is with you. I may give them one more shot since my first few orders of white were perfect but I will probably also make some marshmellow fondant just in case they aren't up to snuff."

Don't get me wrong, it's a great tasting stevia extract and very easy to use, but it is just 6.4 percent stevia and 93.6 percent maltodextrin filler.  In other words only 6 pennies of each dollar you spend on this stuff is buying you high quality stevia extract powder.  In my opinion, this is unnecessarily dilute; however, it does make it exceptionally easy to measure.  If the labeling said 6.4% stevia extract, I would have passed on this from the beginning as I can get 70% dry stevia extract of the same quality for much less money per serving of stevia. If this is your first time buying stevia, go for it as it's easy to use and tastes great.  If you're accustomed to buying and using concentrated stevia extracts, you will be probably be disappointed by the low concentration of this product's mixture.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- 5-star taste<br />- Easy to measure<br />- Perfect for first-time stevia users<br />- 3/4 tsp = ~1 tbsp cane sugar<br /><br />Cons<br />- Only 6.4% stevia<br />- Not cost-competitive with 70% or pure dry stevia extracts<br />- 3/4 tsp = ~1 tbsp cane sugar<br /><br />Overall, a good product but not the best value.  I would given it 4 stars if the product labeling didn't try to hide the fact that it's just not very potent.  For about 1/3 to 1/2 the cost of this product, you can buy concentrated stevia powders and cut them yourself with a low-cost filler like maltodextrin and come out ahead (or just use them full strength, which is often easier once you get used to the sweetening power of pure stevia).<br /><br />In case you're wondering where I got the 6.4% (by mass) value from, this is how I calculated it.  On a precise scale, I found the density of this product to be 2.5 grams per teaspoon.  The label says it contains 40mg per 1/4 tsp.  Thus, 1 tsp has 160mg stevia extract in 2500mg mixed powder.  The concentration (mass) comes to 64mg stevia per gram of product or 6.4 percent by weight.  Pretty weak stuff, but still much sweeter than cane sugar."

The consistency was a tad grainy where it should have a smooth texture. I remember when my mom made fudge it would occasionally turn out grainy and she said it was because the humidity caused the sugar in the candy to crystalize. I don't know if that is the case with this fudge or not, but both this and another Gardiners of Scotland fudge I bought have the same graininess. Further the flavors were odd. The Rum and Raisin was ok, but the raisins had no flavor. The apple and cinnamon didn't taste like apple or cinnamon nor did the strawberry and cream taste like strawberries. I think there was one ginger flavored piece in the can and it was flavorless. I won't be buying Gardiners of Scotland fudge again."

First of all, making a decision on what food to buy is confusing.  They have many breed specific foods and to look at all the bags is exhausting.  With the help of a sales clerk I picked the Medium Breed adult. My dog, at first did like the food very much but I felt he was overwhelmed by the amount of food I had to feed to maintain his caloric need and gradually he lost interest in eating it.  The ingredients list was pretty standard but did have nice levels of antioxidants and omega oils.  Certainly this was not worth the price tag."

It had a slight kick to it, that I love.  A little bit of a bitter taste, which my two older boys seemed to like as well.  In fact my 13 year old was bummed when I said we had finished the can.

So, i fyou are like me and have maybe one carbonated beverage a day, calorie wise you aren't doing yourself any favors by switching to this.

I was born and raised in Hawaii and the delicious shave ice there is a common treat, much like ice cream in the continental US.  Sorry, but these syrups barely taste like the ones in Hawaii.  I sampled the cherry and it tasted very much like cherry cough syrup, yuck!  But that's not what really ticked me off.  Looking at the ingredients listed on the bottle, instead of cane sugar (which Hawaii used to produce and distribute in abundance), the second main ingredient listed after water is high fructose corn syrup.

23429,B004R8J8E0,A2AWVROFGSZU4E,My Fake Name,2,6,2,1311897600,I don't HATE it,"Last night I tried this product according to the instructions.  My oven was at the right temperature, and I baked for just over 12 minutes (around 157 degrees according to my tests).  And I tried it with some center-cut pork chops with the bone in, which should have made the resulting dish better than if I'd chosen plain old no-bone pork chops, but 100% of the three people who consumed these chops agreed they would have preferred them with no coating at all.<br /><br />One person said that the one part of her chop that I missed coating with the product on one side was the single best bite she took.  Another tester said she wished I had merely seared the two surfaces of the chops and left off the coating altogether.<br /><br />I myself appreciated the crunch of this coating, but every bite had an off flavor that I would prefer had not been there.  I too would have preferred no coating at all to the coating this product added to the pork chops.<br /><br />In case you're interested, here's the ingredients list.  ENRICHED WHEAT FLOUR (WHEAT FLOUR, NIACIN, IRON, THIAMIN MONONITRATE (VITAMIN B1), RIBOFLAVIN (VITAMIN B2), FOLIC ACID), SALT, CANOLA OIL, SUGAR, SPICE, CONTAINS LESS THAN 2% OF CARAMEL COLOR, DRIED ONIONS, DEXTROSE, YEAST, EXTRACTIVES OF PAPRIKA, ASCORBIC ACID.  I think you can whip up a reasonable substitute -- except for the caramel color -- by mixing flour and ground corn meal with salt and paprika, and I'd add some pepper if I were you unless you don't want me to.<br /><br />Why shake?<br /><br />Also, I'm not sure why you should bother to put the coating and the chops into a zip-top bag and shake them, especially since you must supply the bag, and especially especially since you must discard it immediately since it's coated in raw pork ick and which also adds maybe 15 cents to the price of the product.  Why can't you just dump the 2.25 ounces of coating onto a plate and dredge?  I get the bake part of Shake 'N Bake, but I don't get the shake part.<br /><br />The package says to buy four to six half-inch-thick pork chops, and I bought one for each of us three diners plus one extra for a total of -- just a moment while I whip out my spreadsheet here -- four.  As you can see from the photograph I've thoughtfully added, they were pretty big chops, and there was not nearly enough coating to have done the last one, not to mention a fifth and sixth.<br /><br />This morning for breakfast I fried the emergency backup pork chop in a little butter but obviously with no coating, and it was much more agreeable than the coated one last night.<br /><br />As a result, I conclude that this product needs improvement, and I rate it two stars.  I'd rate it one star, but that means that I literally hate it, which is a bit strong.  I just have no immediate or even long-term plans to use it again.<br /><br />In case you were wondering, as I can attest from having run the experiments for you, this product does not improve the flavor or texture of tapioca, a mocha latte, or vanilla ice cream (or probably any other flavor, but vanilla was all we had).<br /><br />-- Update: I don't see where we reviewers can add photos to the product page, so I take back what I said above about ""the photograph I've thoughtfully added.""  Maybe later.<br /><br />-- Update of August 8, 2011: I've now been able to add the photo, so please stop emailing me asking when the heck I'm going to get it posted."

Please heed its caution with the utmost of seriousness.<br /><br />If you come across a bag like this, do not open it. The consequences will be great, but I'll get to those later. As for proper disposal, do not let ANYONE see these, as they might be tempted into opening them, seeing the deceptive word ""cookie"" included in the title. You have two options, both of which require items that are difficult to obtain, but which are the only acceptable ways for destruction to ensure these ruinous abominations don't return as even worse creatures. The first is to find some thermite or a similar accelerant that can burn this at over 4000 degrees F. The second option is to use a rocket that can escape Earth's orbit; you must carefully calculate the route to the Sun so that these don't get slingshotted back to us (we cannot risk something like this).<br /><br />As for the consequences: If you've ever seen a Roland Emmerich film (Day After Tomorrow, Independence Day, 2012, Godzilla, etc.) you will recall shots of people running horrified from a central location, scrambling in all futility to escape inexplicable horrors. What I've discovered from months of digging and ""Deep Throat"" style meetings in shady parking garages is that Emmerich adds all of the special effects in post-production, but uses these very cookies as ""inspiration"" for the extras in his film. Finally, you'll understand why all of the lead actors are awful (even talented actors like John Cusack), but all of the extras provide incredibly convincing performances.<br /><br />Andrew Johnson is widely regarded the worst president in US history. Imagine his remains being fermented like sauerkraut, sealed in jars, and then put into a time capsule to be unveiled by this horrendous ""Joseph"" character over 100 years later. The festering stink will stick with you for months. It's as if a skunk mated with sin and the scent was diabolically baked into an innocent-looking cookie.<br /><br />The reason I'm giving it 2 stars instead of just 1 is that these cookies have given me the most amazing idea for a spec horror screenplay.

We tried baby talking, tried bribery, tried everything but force feeding, the brats wouldn't got NEAR this stuff!<br /><br />  Ok, now dogs. Well here is a completely different result. Every dog we tried simply DEVOURED the stuff. Now, when I walk out to get the mail I almost fear for my life with the way these dogs eyeball me:-) But has anyone ever read the label? The far content of 20% plus makes me a pet owner who would NEVER feed this to my pet. Not even as a treat. The manufacturer seems to almost (to me anyway) market this as a pet health food? Sorry, don't care what pet loves it or hates it, I would never give any to any pet since I love them way too much to feed them all that I see on that label. Every time I complain to out Veterinarian about how big our cats are he explains that they are perfect actually. That they are just very large and STRONG, that it is not fat and not to worry. Sure different that what MY doctor tells Me....<br /><br />  Again, I am no Vet, but read the label, look that best friend you call a pet in the eye and ask yourself if you feel right about stuffing it with fat?"

Because I thought they sucked, frankly.  They are completely bland and have no flavor at ALL, and the texture was reminiscent of wallpaper paste.

After letting the batter stand 10 minutes to thicken up a bit, it was more like kindergarten paste, but still totally flavorless.  My 2 year old daughter gobbled them up, so that's something.  Then I cried a litle bit more thinking about the fact that I guess I'll never get to teach her how to make a real, delicious fluffy wheat pancake, but that's a whole other thing.<br /><br />I'm giving it 2 stars just because it is useful for breading oven baked chicken, but you could do that more economically with another GF flour."

Since I work a job which requires a fair amount of travel in a large rural area, finding a 'nutrition bar' or snack food I can eat was a challenge.<br /><br />Cliff bars are easy to find in most Walmarts, and cost just under a dollar each.  They're a little cheaper in case lots -- $5 for a box of 6.  I can only eat 2 kinds, and of course they're popular, so I seldom find them in boxes.  I searched online and was surprised to see Walmart.com offers an assortment of 3 boxes (18 bars) for $15.  They add $1.47 for shipping, but even so, that's a much better price than Amazon's offering here. If you like these, or have a lot of kids and family who do, you may want to check out that source."

That is, until I came across this NY Times article about the sugar they use... [...]<br /><br />From the article:<br /><br />Parents may be buying [Similac Organic] because they believe that organic is healthier, but babies may have a reason of their own for preferring Similac Organic: it is significantly sweeter than other formulas. It is the only major brand of organic formula that is sweetened with cane sugar, or sucrose, which is much sweeter than sugars used in other formulas.<br /><br />No health problems in babies have been associated with Similac Organic. But to pediatricians, there are risks in giving babies cane sugar: Sucrose can harm tooth enamel faster than other sugars; once babies get used to its sweeter taste, they might resist less sweet formulas or solid foods; and some studies suggest that they might overeat, leading to rapid weight gain in the first year, which is often a statistical predictor of childhood obesity."

Seriously?,"It's hard to find a good quality whole leaf tea in bags, and the great reviews this brand received were pretty convincing. So I gave it a shot, in spite of my usual preference for organic or fair trade teas. Sadly, there is an unpleasantly strong perfumey odor and taste to this Earl Grey and when I looked at the ingredients, the reason was quite clear. It is comprised of whole leaf black tea along with natural and ARTIFICIAL flavors. Why the artificial flavors? Isn't a top quality oil of bergamot enough? It is for me. Unfortunately, grocery items cannot be returned to Amazon, so I'm stuck with three tins of tea that I will probably never drink."

The flavors vary from terrible to passable. I couldn't finish the pack of what they call ""salt and vinegar"" chips.<br /><br />I suppose these chips might be popular with people who are trying to watch their weight.<br /><br />An anecdote: the day after I received these I gave the rest away to the other people in my dorm (who proceeded to affirm my suspicions that these chips were subpar).

It came out of the can in big globs that were sticky to try to mush down for my gang.

Since it came in six canisters, they gave me one.<br /><br />I was expecting white tea. This is not a white tea. It is not a good Ceylon tea either. It is easily overpowered anything you add to it. The tea tastes like water with a very sight hint of pomegranate. Even though the tea liquor is very dark, no flavor. This is advertised as a white tea but it isn't. When you brew a decent white tea, no matter how much tea you use, it still stays light and has a grassy, nutty taste. This is a Ceylon but not in the English Breakfast sense because it did not have enough edge like a good Ceylon or Assam have.<br /><br />When brewing it, I brewed it like a white tea. 160 degree water. It turned dark brown immediately so i knew it wasn't a white tea. The next time i made it i brewed it like a straight up black tea. No flavor. Tried two bags. Still not great. Watery with a very, very sight hint of a fruity taste in an 8oz cup.<br /><br />It comes in a round canister like Republic of Teas but inside is a vacuum sealed aluminum bag with all 50 of the tea bags smashed together. Inspecting the bags found very ground up tea powder. After brewing, no leaves in sight, just a lump of tea dust. I guess this is why it turned color so fast.<br /><br />I take tea with no sugar or milk. I guess if you add enough sugar, any tea can taste decent.

So I planted the seeds on Friday and by Sunday night, I had wheatgrass sprouts like crazy. The instructions are clear and easy to follow, and deliver abundant grass as promised.<br /><br />I have to say, though, that the grass doesn't look at all like the wheatgrass in stores.

I took pictures but discovered that my camera's memory card doesn't fit this new computer, so I can't show prospective buyers a picture of it. Rats. Since bunnies have sensitive digestive systems and you have to be careful what you feed them, I don't feel safe feeding this grass to her.

It has a unique, natural taste, albeit not as sweet as the ""store-bought"" name-brand syrups that you find in the grocery stores.  But then again, apparently the sugar content is less, thus it is undoubtedly better for you. But, I guess that's pointless if you end up not wanting to use it.  My kids would not touch the stuff.<br /><br />Also, it is expensive for what you get.  I bought it at a special discount from the regular Amazon price, and it was still expensive even with the discount.  A bit too expensive, IMHO.  The photo can be a bit deceiving too; it comes in a very small jug...check the ounce figure carefully before making your buying decision.<br /><br />Edit - Sept 2010:  I thought I would update this review and let you know that after a few months, we ended up throwing this syrup away (about a third was left) because it had stayed on the shelf for so long, mold started to grow.  My kids continued to refuse to eat it.  Even I started going back to the store-bought brands. I read an interesting article in Esquire magazine that made me remember this product and my review...and made me smile:<br /><br />""People give 100 percent real maple syrup as gifts. People take their kids to farms to see it collected and cooked. In the Northeast, it's extolled. Which is strange, because it's not as good as Aunt Jemima or Mrs. Butterworth's, its mass market imitators. First of all, syrup shouldn't run, it should ooze. Real maple syrup runs. The mass market stuff - the stuff you grew up on - that stuff oozes. It has viscosity. So instead of going straight into the pancakes, like water into a sponge, it maintains their integrity. And the taste: Mass-market syrup is sweet.  Real maple syrup is a beguiling combination of sugar and resin. Which is authentic, sure. But bark is authentic.  Is there anything else we eat that tastes vaguely of tree?""<br /><br />I couldn't have said it better. I'll give it two stars instead of one because we did muddle through the stuff for a week or two and at least at first, perhaps because of the novelty, we though we liked it.  However, our enthusiasm quickly dwindled.  Think twice before you buy.<br /><br />Second edit: Sept 2010 - I found this information regarding real maple syrup, which may be why this Grade B version made me (and my kids) avoid it...apparently this grade is best for cooking:<br /><br />Here's how real maple syrups differ from each other...<br /><br />Grade A Light Amber or Vermont Fancy usually is made early in the season and has a mild, delicate flavor. It's often used for maple candies.<br /><br />Grade A Medium Amber is darker and has a more robust maple flavor. It's typically used for pancakes and waffles.<br /><br />Grade A Dark Amber, darker still, has strong maple and caramel-like flavors. It can be used for pancakes if you like a more intense flavor, as well as for cooking.<br /><br />Grade B is very dark and has the strongest flavor, mostly maple but also with hints of caramel. It's the best choice for cooking."

We decided to switch her from Purina Pro Plan w/ Shredded Chicken to a premium food. After reading many conflicting reviews on this site and elsewhere, we decided to try Canidae. My sister feeds Canidae with great results and, at our local pet store, it is the cheapest of the premium foods by a narrow margin.<br /><br />We mixed only a little Canidae into Penny's kibble. My guess is about 6-8 pieces or 1/12 of her total breakfast/dinner. We watched her very closely. Within a day, we noticed some changes. First of all, she lost a little focus in training, seeming a bit more confused than usual. No biggie. She also sneezed a few times (she has never sneezed before). More importantly, though, we noticed that she started to nibble and chew on her feet. This continued sporadically for another day and half. It wasn't constant or serious. She didn't seem agitated and she didn't bite her feet to the point of redness or bleeding. Still, it was VERY clear that this was caused by the change in diet (nothing else in her routine changed) and this was only with 12-16 pieces of Canidae per day. Having read the reviews of Canidae's new formula, we had known that this might happen. We made the decision to switch right away.<br /><br />After a lot of research, we decided to try Solid Gold Hund-N-Flocken for Puppies. We mixed in the Solid Gold at the same proportions as the Canidae. The nibbling stopped immediately. No sneezing, either. Her focus seems to have improved as well, though I can't completely credit that to the food because puppies have on and off days. Still, it is clear that the more serious allergy problems have been resolved.<br /><br />If you've done any research on dog foods at all, you already know that finding the right food requires you to go beyond the ingredient list. Some foods just don't work with some dogs, however good they look on paper. Indeed, I am convinced after many hours of reading reviews that NO food works for ALL dogs. That said, it is clear that many, many more people have had problems with the new Canidae formula than they have with other premium or super-premium brands. Who knows why (Canidae claims the new formula has no changes that could account for allergies), and who cares? Feel free to try Canidae for your dog, but watch him or her very closely. Or, better yet, do what I wish I did, and just start with a different brand. There is nothing special about the Canidae ingredients list, so why risk it?"

This was my first time ordering  Hidden Springs Vermont Maple Syrup, and I did so because the other brands weren't available in the 1 Half Gallon variety. I wanted to go with 1 Half Gallon this time because I go through the 32 oz. containers too quick and the Hidden Springs Maple Syrup also saved me money by buying it in bulk. Now to the bad part, I usually purchase either the Coombs Family Farms or Highland Sugarworks brands of maple syrup and I love their taste; it was a bitter disappointment when I first tasted the Hidden Springs Maple Syrup and realized I'd made a huge mistake.<br /><br />I do not cook with these syrups, I use them for one thing and one thing only -- pancakes, waffles, or French-Toast. The aforementioned brands I usually purchase are awesome on my breakfast products, but the Hidden Springs Maple Syrup had a very funny off-putting taste that made it impossible to enjoy my breakfast. Don't get me wrong, it isn't nasty, but in comparison to Coombs or Highlands it is terrible.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I feel like I wasted $36 on maple syrup, as I now have about 60 oz. of Hidden Springs Maple Syrup that I won't eat. Perhaps it'll make a good cooking syrup and I can find some good recipes calling for maple syrup. But in summation, if you're going to spend this much money on maple syrup, buy Coombs or Highlands, there's a reason they are the top purchased syrups on Amazon."

But as of last year I got really serious with  my diet and remembered that these did indeed get me to sweat alot more, so i went ahead and ordered a 24 pack of these orange flavored ones.  Personally I think if you can stomach cola then your better off buying the cola flavor.  I hate cola flavor so I think this and Green Tea peach/Mango are the better ones.

I enjoy the flavor of ginger as well as lemon by themselves but had never put the two together, although it makes sense if it's made right because they can balance each other with the right combination of quantities, a mix of bitter, sweet and sour.  The flavor of the ginger in this instance definitely over-powered the lemon and was just altogether way too potent for my taste buds.  This may be to the liking of those who like or can handle really spicy foods but this disagreed with my sensibility.  I measured it right with 250 ml of water (about an 8 oz. cup) and I tried it both hot and cold but it was too powerful either way.  Now if they greatly reduced the amount of ginger and focused on the lemon with just a hint of ginger, they'd be onto something, but as it stands it's quite simply too strong.  The amount of lemon was just fine but someone dropped the ball when mixing it with ginger.  I like the concept but it needs more work before it's perfected."

That only helped marginally.<br /><br />I'm a long time, daily coffee drinker, and this may be the worst tasting coffee I've ever had.

However, the ingredient list is rather extensive and includes many different types of sugar in the form of sugar: fructose, invert sugar syrup, sugar, honey, corn syrup and brown sugar molasses.  Quite a variety of sugars there!  Which is interesting, since the cookie itself isn't very sweet.  Actually, the sweetness level is just right, in my opinion.<br /><br />The total carbohydrate count for one cookie is 26 grams.  Total fat = 8 grams.  Sugars = 9 grams.  I'm not so sure that this is the healthiest option for a snack.  Probably a better choice than a candy bar since it has fiber, but not something you'd want to snack on if you're on a diet.<br /><br />Bottom line?

Weigh the others as you will, but the proof is still in the pudding.<br /><br />The texture is their best asset (if you like that sort of texture); that's about it for me. They appear to be an extruded potato product (many of those out there) with various seasonings that do not impress me, either. The most basic of them puts 160mg of sodium into the TINY .8oz package. If you were a deer, you might eat them for that alone. The fat is reduced, that much is true. But...<br /><br />Unless you are ready to trade fat for sodium, it's no deal. But wait... baked kettle chips, in a 1oz serving, up the fat to... 3G, the same as the .8 of the basic flavor. You got .2OZ free on that one. The baked kettles possess 135mg sodium, vs. 160. These chips give you 1G fiber in .8 vs. 2 in 1oz of baked kettles. This product loses again.<br /><br />The only place you might 'gain' is in carbs 21 for the kettle chips, 15 for these, but remember... you have .2oz extra in the kettle's nutrition info... just about a wash.<br /><br />And then, topping it all - the cost... $0.92 an oz vs $0.44 for baked kettles in subscription. Wow. These wonderful snacks cost $14.72 per pound, packed as they are. The prices will fluctuate... but think about the things you can buy for that money instead. These are microscopic bags (that does not help the environment, either - portion control aside) with product largely deriving its kick from sodium and cheap spices.<br /><br />The most positive thing I can say is the product is packed very well. Lots of air in the bags to protect the chips, and they will mostly arrive intact in their tiny portions in tiny bags. You won't have many crumbs in the bottoms of these little bags, so that is a good thing.<br /><br />But... bottom line... expensive junk ""health food"". ""Wow!""."

42891,B002NHYQAS,A3JCWGHCVC2ZNF,Sheri in Reho,2,4,2,1299283200,I expected a lot more from the Newman's Own brand.,"I have tried a couple of products from the Newman's Own line and, while I didn't necessarily think they were better than their competitors' products of the same type, they definitely held their own.  I sadly did not find this to be true with the Newman's Own Organics Dark Chocolate Bar.<br /><br />When it comes to reviewing edible products, I find it helpful to compare and contrast with a similar product from another brand.  Because I love Dove Dark Chocolate (though I try many different kinds of dark chocolate), I used the Dove Silky Smooth Dark Chocolate Bar as comparison (though I prefer the Dove Promise individual bites, it was easier to compare bar to bar).<br /><br />The Dove Dark Bar is 33 grams and the serving size is the entire bar.  The Newman's Own Organics Dark Chocolate Bar is 64 grams, nearly double the size of the Dove Bar, and still 1 serving is considered the entire bar.  Now, I am as much of a chocolate lover as the next person (probably more, in fact), but there is no way I need nor want to eat to consume 64g of chocolate in one sitting (especially sub-par chocolate).<br /><br />In most nutritional areas, especially fat and sat fat, the 33g Dove bar and the 64g Newman bar are almost equal if you consider that one is double the size of the other.  Newman's only clear win over the Dove bar is on cholesterol, having 0mg even though it is double the size of the Dove (which has 5mg cholesterol).  For those watching sugar, the smaller Dove bar has 17g while Big Daddy Newman has 37g.<br /><br />With the health business out of the way, let's get down to brass tacks--taste and texture:<br /><br />Texture.  I am accustomed to the smooth, creamy texture of Dove dark chocolate--I find its mouth feel luxurious.  My initial thought on biting into and chewing the Newman was waxiness--quite nasty at first but, once I got it chewed, it had a nicer mouth feel.  It is not creamy like Dove, but it loses the waxiness once chewed.<br /><br />Taste.  The only thing particularly pleasant to me about the Newman bar was the finish...the very last taste as you're swallowing it.  That has a deep rich dark chocolate taste and, despite the 37g of sugar in it, is not overly sweet, which is nice.  As for Dove, the entire process of biting into it, chewing it and swallowing it is enjoyable, so there is no contest.<br /><br />In summary, if you have your heart set on contributing to Newman's Own because of the good work they do, or you must have an organic chocolate bar, I suppose this will do.  But it is not, in my opinion, any competition for ANY other brand of good dark chocolate I have tried."

23114,B004ZIER34,A100ZQDV7L8PVV,"Karen Vaughan ""Herblady""",0,0,2,1312070400,pH near neutral but so is the flavor,"I have tried this coffee hot and iced,with milk and black and I tested the pH.  Frankly it won't qualify as a great cup of coffee.  The flavor is burnt (like Starbucks dark roast) but is flat and it lacks middle notes and vanillins (unlike Starbucks.)  Perhaps flavors other than French Roast would be better at providing complexity as that frequently comes from Colombian roast in a blend. The aroma is underwhelming.<br /><br />The pH of the Puroast coffee tested at 6.5, slightly acidic (neutral is 7 on a scale of 0-14.0) but less so than normal coffee.  Normal coffee ranges from around 5.0 - 5.1, more neutral than beer or any fruit juice and similar to carbonated water. If you can drink those, then your stomach isn't reacting to the acidity but something else. So normal coffee, whether it irritates you or not, isn't all that acidic.  Acidity generally refers to a flavor note in coffee rather than pH and coffee without acid flavor notes tastes flat.  Irritation may instead come from the essential oils in the beans or the caffeine.<br /><br />(Having too much stomach acid has exactly the same symptoms as too little stomach acid and most people over 35 are slightly deficient in hydrochloric acid and 50% of people over 50 are seriously hypochlorhydric, but we are taught to regard the symptoms as being from acidity. Your Tums work by other mechanisms, beyond the scope of this review.)<br /><br />So while Puroast is attempting to solve an acid/base problem that doesn't significantly exist, the fact that the flavor is low probably means that the essential oils in the beans are lowered as well, making the coffee less irritating.  Frankly I'd rather add about 20% chicory to good coffee, which slightly sweetens the taste and is less irritating.  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001M11HI"">Frontier Natural - Chicory - Roasted, 1 lbs</a>Is it worth giving up flavor to drink coffee?

I was browsing when I stumbled upon an article about miracle berries- a cool new fad that apparently causes things to taste different than they normally would. Naturally, I tried to see where I could get my hands on some.<br /><br />Once I found the mberry Miracle Fruit Tablets, I did some research. I always look at a lot of reviews and alternatives before buying anything on Amazon. The price was relatively cheap, I figured, if it worked as advertised. The aggressive claims on the product's page and the Amazon user reviews also furthered my need to investigate this mystery product, so I bought two packs- one for me and one for my friend.<br /><br />After both of us trying the Miracle Berry tablets, I'd have to say that the product is extremely overhyped, and the experience was, unfortunately, lacking.<br /><br />The way mberry talks about their tablets, you'd expect to have a Willy Wonka-esque food tasting bonanza.

The HPD information states that these sticks come from free-roaming bulls, but, who knows what I received.

Many are around 1/4 inch.  Only a few are close to 1 inch.<br /><br />My cocker spaniel plowed through one of these sticks in about five minutes.  Hardly the distraction that I intended.<br /><br />Typically I purchase Cadet 12"" bully sticks, cutting them down to 4 inch sticks.

I didn't care for its dryer texture or bitter taste. Then I was diagnosed with gestational diabetes and chocolate pretty much became a no-no. Through careful experimentation though, I discovered I could occasionally enjoy a square of dark chocolate with higher cacao percentages because they have less sugar. I began to appreciate the flavor of chocolate without the milky sweetness and have since been a big fan.<br /><br />Keeping that in mind I'm always trying new brands and blends in search of the perfect dark chocolate bar. Unfortunately, as much as I love Newman's Own as a company and many of their other products this chocolate was just not for me. It's too sweet and the vanilla taste came through strong. It melted into a watery consistency in my mouth and almost had an alcohol-like tang to it. Once I'd noticed that tang I checked the ingredient list and sure enough it's made with chocolate liquor which some may like but I personally don't care for when I reach for dark chocolate.<br /><br />At only 54% cocoa this is pretty low on the spectrum of darker chocolates and with it's texture would be a great introduction to dark chocolate for someone who doesn't like it usually. It kind of reminded me of an oversweetened version of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002RBRY0Y"">Lindt Lindor Truffles Dark Chocolate, 60-Count Box</a>'s centers.

It is traditionally served cold in large glasses with long slices of pickled carrots, called tane (or in some accents, dene.) Hot paprika relish is added just before drinking. Hot or regular, it is a popular drink with Adana kebab.<br />&#350;algam is often served with rak&#305; (alcoholic beverage)--not mixed, but rather in a separate glass.

I read all the labels and was surprised to find that most of them said that they contained between only 82 to 90 percent raw ingredients.  I'm trying to keep 100% raw while I (hopefully) recover from an illness, so the only flavor I purchased was the one that did not say it was less than 100% raw- the hazelnut chocolate.  I was very pleased that it was delicious and satisfying. I intended to make it my breakfast five days a week during my commute, and perhaps see if I could buy cases of it.<br /><br />Then the first box arrived today. The top of the box read ""90.6% raw.""  I was surprised and disappointed that I had missed that on the label in the store. Concerned that I was losing cognitive function, I went to my garbage box of non-compostable-nor-recyclables and found the wrapper from last week. I examined it carefully and it did not mention that these contain 9.4% cooked ingredients. I opened the box that had just arrived and saw that the bar labels were the same as last week: no mention of non-raw ingredients.<br /><br />Note their legal disclaimer on this site:<br /><br />""Actual product packaging and materials may contain more and different information than what is shown on our website. We recommend that you do not rely solely on the information presented and that you always read labels, warnings, and directions before using or consuming a product.""<br /><br />-- They may want to add that you should also not rely on the info on their labels.<br /><br />I don't recall seeing the 90.6% figure on this site last week. I don't have evidence that they didn't have it posted here, but as you can see from this review I'm a pretty obsessive reader of info about the things I eat.<br /><br />In sum:  Their labeling is misleading about the raw content of the hazelnut chocolate bar. At the very least, given what I've experienced and what they seem to feel they need to place in their legal disclaimer, I don't believe this brand is worthy of the trust of the people I care about just yet.  I hope very much that changes, and that I can buy their products in the future. For now I'm boycotting until they are more honest in their labeling and less disingenuous in their branding.

It tastes like strongly-flavored puffed rice covered in chocolate and my first impression was ""chocolate covered popcorn"".  Mine was so melted it was soup and I had to put in the freezer to make it edible.  The melting and refreezing made it waxy and a somewhat unpleasant, unrecognizable mound of candy with which I had to literally peel the wrapper off.  My rating here is for the taste and texture only although it may or may not have tasted better if not ruined.<br /><br />*Also beware of ordering this if you live in a warm climate.  I don't enjoy receiving melted chocolate and had no other problems with any other chocolate melting that I ordered from other sources that month.  I'll assume it was the product ingredients making it susceptible to melting easily so it should have had special warm-weather wrapping when this is a problem.  Even though the vendor shipped more quickly than usual the product was ruined.  Many chocolate companies won't even sell their products during the warm months unless they can adjust to this problem and neither should this one. No refund or partial refund was even offered by the seller (O.E.I.) yet I was hounded constantly by them about my ""seller review"" per half a dozen telephone calls. I eventually deleted the seller review for reasons I'll not explain further. In my opinion, this is an over-priced waste of money."

I failed to scroll down and see the information stating that in order to assure the use of ice gels, orders needed to be Expedited. So, on a $26 order, I would pay an additional $30+ for Expedited delivery. When I initially received my melted chocolates, I contacted Euro Food Mart and received a very rude and curt reply from Cris in Customer Service informing me that during the checkout process I was offered shipping with ice gels, but I chose to decline it. Sadly, the melted chocolates did not fair any better after being refrigerated. They cracked easily and no filling was discernable.

That is just not true. Porcini from Europe taste better: the terroir changes the mushroom's flavor considerably, just as it changes the flavor of grapes made into wine. Since JR Mushrooms refuses to reveal their country of origin, I must assume they are selling cheaper, possibly contaminated mushrooms from China in order to make a bigger profit. Beware!

It had soft pieces of jerky mixed with annoying hard pieces of jerky. The meat has a nice fat to meat ratio, you know when you bite down on a fatty piece of meat. However, the hard pieces had tendon or sinew. On some pieces I could pull the silver sinew out and use it to floss my teeth. Not palatable at all. Generally the jerky is somewhat grainy due to the spices but is palatable. A strong peppery taste permeated the jerky. I felt like some of the pieces were not mixed properly, some pieces of meat were more salty than others.<br /><br />The taste is quite enjoyable. (I'm known to eat anything... & can acquire taste) If you don't mind fishing out the bad parts...<br /><br />However, my second bag developed some kind of mold. I started on the second bag without knowing that this bag contained a mold ball right in the middle of the bag. About half way through I found the moldy meat. I had read of this occurring in some people's product but I dismissed it as a freak chance.<br /><br />The mold is white, it reminds me of bread fluff. The mold is very bitter. I just reached into the bag for a piece of jerky & bit down on a moldy piece. I promptly spat it out and saw the middle part of the bag was fully rotten. IMHO.<br /><br />Would I buy this product again?<br /><br />No. a 50% chance of getting moldy meat... Well I don't wanna chance it."

Meaning, I want the experience to be motivating and rewarding. After testing this product on all three of my dogs, I think this stuff is too organic and wholesome for me and my pooches.<br /><br />CONS - When I opened the bag, I noticed these organic treats were very hard. I couldn't break them up with my hand to give in little pieces or use for training. I had to give the treat as a whole biscuit. Also they were very fibrous looking. Much like those unappealing high-fiber diet bars that humans eat when they're on some sort of regimented weight loss program. Also, I prefer my dog treats to be in cute shapes...bones, hearts, rounds, rolls, etc. These were just regular squares. And since the cookies were so hard, I was afraid the corners would cut the mouths/gums of my smaller dogs.<br /><br />PROS - If you read the label, the ingredients are high quality. They're the stuff I look for when I buy their every day food.<br /><br />Dog tested: My big German Shepard, who usually likes chicken jerky treats (and won't eat anything that has a smoky flavor like Beggin Strips), ate her biscuits. However, she wasn't terribly interested and definitely didn't think it was treat. It looked as if she just ate it because it smelled edible and it was there. She didn't even wolf it down like she normally does with her treats. My Cocker Spaniel, who usually begs me for everything and is highly food motivated, took a sniff and and a lick but ultimately was not interested in these wholesome treats.

It's not related to the other deaths.<br /><br />[...]<br />Natural Balance Pet Foods,¬Æ Inc. Issues A Voluntary Nationwide Recall on Specific Venison Dog & Cat Food Products<br /><br />Contact:<br />Consumer Inquiries:<br />(800) 829-4493<br />Media Inquiries:<br />Daniel Bernstein<br />310-275-0777<br /><br />FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE -- Pacoima, CA -- April 17, 2007-- Natural Balance, Pacoima, CA, is issuing a voluntary nationwide recall for all of its Venison dog products and the dry Venison cat food only, regardless of date codes. The recalled products include Venison and Brown Rice canned and bagged dog foods, Venison and Brown Rice dog treats, and Venison and Green Pea dry cat food. Recent laboratory results show that the products contain melamine. We believe the source of the melamine is a rice protein concentrate. Natural Balance has confirmed this morning that some production batches of these products may contain melamine.<br /><br />The recall was prompted by consumer complaints received by Natural Balance involving a small number of cats and dogs that developed kidney failure after eating the affected product.<br /><br />Dogs or cats who have consumed the suspect food and show signs of kidney failure (such as loss of appetite, lethargy and vomiting) should be seen by a veterinarian. We recommend our customers immediately stop feeding our recalled venison products regardless of date code and return unused product to their retailer for a full refund.<br /><br />The products are packaged in bags, cans and zip lock treat bags and sold in pet specialty stores and PetCo nationally.<br />No other Natural Balance products are involved in this voluntary recall as none of our other formulas include the rice protein concentrate.<br /><br />Although the problems seem to be focused on a particular production period of the venison products, over the last four days we have notified our distributors and retailers by phone and e-mail to immediately stop selling and return all recalled Venison dog foods and treats and the Venison dry cat food. Venison canned cat food is not involved.<br /><br />The source of the melamine appears to be a rice protein concentrate, which was recently added to the dry venison formulas. Natural Balance does not use wheat gluten, which was associated with the previous melamine contamination.<br /><br />We continue to work closely with the FDA in their ongoing investigation.<br /><br />Consumers with questions may contact the company at 1-800-829-4493 or email [...]<br /><br />another one:<br /><br />Breaking Voluntary Recall News: Thursday, April 26th, 2007<br /><br />Our canned food manufacturer, American Nutrition, from Ogden Utah, just informed us that they are recalling all canned products made in their plant that contain rice protein concentrate. American Nutrition continued by telling us that they added this ingredient to four of our canned products without our knowledge or consent. The four products involved are:<br /><br />Chicken Formula Canned Dog Food 13 oz<br />Lamb Formula Canned Dog Food 13 oz<br />Beef Formula Canned Dog Food 13 oz<br />Ocean Fish Formula Canned Cat Food 3 oz & 6 oz<br /><br />There have been no illnesses reported related to feeding these formulas, however, to comply with the American Nutrition recall of the four products, we are pulling all dates and batches of these four formulas. We also ask that our customers return unused product for a full credit to their store.<br /><br />To make sure that this does not happen in the future, we are demanding from each of our co-manufacturers daily production record of all of our formulas before they are shipped to us and written certification of NO rice protein or any deviation of our formulas. We have reviewed all of our other products and determined that they are free of rice protein concentrate and that all of our other product labels are accurate."

They don't last 7 years. I replaced all the bulbs in my house two years ago. Half of them are kaput. Another lie.<br />3. The light temperature isn't neutral. Install these in your kitchen and your food will look inedible. Especially anything with red sauce.<br />You could switch back to the good old incandescent ones, but by years end, they will be taken off the market. The 100 watt ones were banned at the end of 2011. The 75s are next.<br />Thanks Washington for running our lives. Where would we be without you? Answer: Better off."

On the first night, I figured she'd eaten something bad off the street. On the second night, I figured it was the lingering effects of eating something bad off the street. On the third night, I started looking for other causes for the nighttime retching, and I realized that the vomiting had started on the same day as we'd started the new bag. I stopped feeding the dog the Newman's Own and the vomiting stopped for 2 nights. Last night, I fed her the food again, and sure enough, she threw up in the night.<br /><br />I trusted and liked this food - and all things under the Newman's Own brand - but i'll never buy their products again.

However, there definitely is some sort of production problem with the cans of oatmeal with a July 2012 expiration date.<br /><br />First, there is a distinct smell with this oatmeal. This oatmeal has a strong stale smell and looks grey in color. All other oatmeals have almost no smell at all and have a consistent light-khaki color.<br /><br />Second, the HappyBellies oatmeal does not thicken formula as other oatmeals do. Our son has acid reflux and we were told to add one tablespoon of oatmeal per ounce of formula. When I use Gerber oatmeal with DHA and probiotics, this makes the formula very thick - sludgelike. With the HappyBellies, no matter how much I add it doesn't thicken the formula at all. It remains watery and not suitable for a baby who spits up excessively.<br /><br />Third, I think our son has an allergic reaction to this oatmeal. He has no issue using the non-organic Gerber oatmeal with DHA and probiotics, but with the HappyBellies he has thrown up the formula/oatmeal immediately after eating it as if his stomach was upset. He also seemed to break out in a rash after putting him on HappyBellies after a couple of days.<br /><br />I agree with the other reviews that there definitely seems to be something wrong with this batch of oatmeal. I suspect that moisture somehow go into the oatmeal before it was sealed and as a result it rotted in the can, thus causing a bad smell, a grey color, and unable to absorb the moisture from the formula to thicken the solution. The grey color has even made me wonder if it's mold that has grown on the oatmeal.<br /><br />It's very clear to me that HappyBellies should issue a voluntary recall of this product!"

I have no idea what they use to flavor them, but it tastes like a strange mixture of salt and soap. There's enough salt in them to kill a horse, which in and of itself wouldn't be so bad (I actually like salty things) but when combined with whatever garbage they dug out of their backed up shower and called seasoning, it left me hunting for listerine - or gasoline, whatever I could get my hands on - to get the taste out of my mouth.

Delayed response, but finally got emails and they were courteous but they redirected me to try help center to get credit and get the correct item. Gone through hoops in the help center of Amazon to no avail. Until I found the Toll Free Amazon phone number, Amazon LLC confirmed they can not accept the return, but will send the correct item promptly.

Updated  review Sept 30th 2009, I finally got the ordered item, partly because the Amazon rep corrected it when I called in and sent it fast!

I've had pork rinds from the stores and thought they were pretty good, so I expected this to be at or better than my local convenience store brand.  Wrong.  I was first disappointed with the texture.  After following the instructions to microwave from 1-2 minutes, some (about 1/4) were crispy, but the rest were almost like taffy and would stick to the teeth?  Perhaps I didn't cook long enough, so 2nd bag stayed in longer which made a few more crispy, but more burnt and chewy ones.  But texture is only 1/2 the problem, the biggest issue was that the product taste like the bag. The taste of the microwave bag seems to bake into the product giving them a paper bag taste.  Finally,those without the full paper bag taste didn't really have a lot of flavor.  They were salty (which is to be expected),but that's really all the flavor you get.  So if your desperate and too lazy to get out a store (or can't find any in a near by store), this may work for you.  It  works out to about $1.00 a bag, so I'm not totally disappointed as my dog loves them.  By the way, my dog gives them 5 stars."

Well all I have to say is I taste no semblance of carrots at all.  It tasted more like drinking a bad V-8 or something.  Then after sipping a couple of ounces I now have an acid reflux feeling in my throat and chest.  I drink water with lemon pretty often and never have that happen.

I tried a bite and these don't even taste anything like sweet potatoes.  They are very dark brown and tasted like minerals and quite unnatural.  My daughter ate the two bites I gave her but I felt too guilty feeding her anymore and dumped out the bowl...and my garbage smells terrible now."

I looked everywhere and could not find ont. So I had one overnighted from Amazon on NYE and it came yesterday. I pick this one because of the Rudolph theme. The gingerbread itself came broken. Like unable to use would need a glue gun to get it to work broken. It's non returnable. I called Amazon, they were nice enough to order me a second one since I spend a ton of money each year with them. This one also came broken. I order A LOT from Amazon and things do not come broken. I think only one time have I had returned something because it was broken in 100's of orders. But two of the same thing in a row?! I think it's the kit itself and nothing to do with how it was shipped. I will say most come UPS and overnight comes Fed Ed. But it's bubble wrapped very well. I think the gingerbread isn't good and cracks in shipping and breaks off. The rest of the kit is very cute. The first kit the candies had spilled out and where a mess in the box. But the second kit while the gingerbread was all broken up again the candies were all in their bags. Too bad. But I would try something else, stay away from this one."

No one, including myself, has been successful in getting any sort of satisfactory reply from Canidae when asked if they had changed formulas, ingredient suppliers, etc. I'm disappointed-- Canidae was one of the few 'quality foods' that had not raised prices significantly over the past year and was still affordable for most dog owners.

21626,B002BCD2GO,A1TQIPT2QBAS6Z,Ddanimal,13,18,1,1335830400,"Agave ""nectar"" is a scam","from Jonny Bowden, PhD, C.N.S.:<br /><br />Agave syrup (nectar) is basically high-fructose corn syrup masquerading as a health food.<br /><br />Sorry. Don't kill the messenger.<br /><br />It's easy to understand how agave syrup got its great reputation. Even the word ""Agave"" has a fine pedigree, coming from the Greek word for noble. The blue agave species- considered the best for the making agave nectar -- flourishes in rich volcanic soil. (It's also the only variety permitted to be used for the making of tequila.) And extracts from the agave plant have been shown to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.<br /><br />Unfortunately there's zero evidence that any of those compounds are present in the commercially made syrup.<br /><br />Agave nectar is an amber-colored liquid that pours more easily than honey and is considerably sweeter than sugar. The health-food crowd loves it because it is gluten-free and suitable for vegan diets, and, most especially, because it's low-glycemic (we'll get to that in a moment). Largely because of its very low glycemic impact, agave nectar is marketed as ""diabetic friendly"". What's not to like?<br /><br />As it turns out, quite a lot.<br /><br />Agave nectar has a low-glycemic index for one reason only: it's largely made of fructose, which although it has a low-glycemic index, is probably the single most damaging form of sugar when used as a sweetener. With the exception of pure liquid fructose, agave nectar has the highest fructose content of any commercial sweetener.<br /><br />All sugar -- from table sugar to HFCS (high-fructose corn syrup) to honey -- contains some mixture of fructose and glucose. Table sugar is 50/50, HFCS is 55/45. Agave nectar is a whopping 90 percent fructose, almost -- but not quite -- twice as high as HFCS.<br /><br />Fructose -- the sugar found naturally in fruit -- is perfectly fine when you get it from whole foods like apples (about 7 percent fructose) -- it comes with a host of vitamins, antioxidants and fiber. But when it's commercially extracted from fruit, concentrated and made into a sweetener, it exacts a considerable metabolic price.<br /><br />Research shows that it's the fructose part of sweeteners that's the most dangerous. Fructose causes insulin resistance and significantly raises triglycerides (a risk factor for heart disease). It also increases fat around the middle which in turn puts you at greater risk for diabetes, heart disease and Metabolic Syndrome (AKA pre-diabetes) .<br /><br />And fructose has been linked to non-alcoholic, fatty-liver disease. Rats that were given high fructose diets developed a number of undesirable metabolic abnormalities including elevated triglycerides, weight gain and extra abdominal fat.<br /><br />In the agave plant, most of the sweetness comes from a particular kind of fructose called inulin, which actually has some health benefits -- it's considered a fiber. Inulin is a fructose polymer and is not digestible. But there's not much inulin left in the actual syrup. In the manufacturing process, enzymes are added to the inulin to separate the inulin into fructose molecules, resulting in a syrup that has a fructose content that is, at best, 57 percent and -- much more commonly -- as high as 90 percent.<br /><br />""Agave syrup is almost all fructose, highly processed sugar with great marketing,"" said Dr. Ingrid Kohlstadt, a fellow of the American College of Nutrition and an associate faculty member at Johns Hopkins School of Public Health. ""Fructose interferes with healthy metabolism when (consumed) at higher doses"", she told me. ""Many people have fructose intolerance like lactose intolerance. They get acne or worse diabetes symptoms even though their blood [sugar] is OK"".<br /><br />Agave nectar syrup is a triumph of marketing over science. True, it has a low-glycemic index, but so does gasoline -- that doesn't mean it's good for you."

Two others in my family sampled this cookie and were equally appalled at its taste.  So, let's start there.  This cookie is almost tasteless:  no almond flavor; nor chocolate; and there is no pronounced earthy oatmeal flavor, too.<br /><br />The cookie is soft, and while I don't care for soft cookies, the other two do, but this soft baked oatmeal cookie didn't win any fans between them.  To Quaker's credit, they individually wrap each cookie to maintain its softness.<br /><br />Each cookie is nearly 200 calories for barely more than an ounce of pleasure.  The box's photo leads one to believe there are large chunks of chocolate and almonds lodged in each cookie.  That's just not the case--unless you are viewing them with a magnifying glass.<br /><br />In our house, cookies cannot get stale.  They're gobbled up and gone in no time.  It's no exaggeration to say that this less-than-half-eaten cookie sat on the kitchen counter for over 24 hours and would be there still, had we not thrown it into the garbage can.<br /><br />Overall, this new product is a disappointment.  If it were possible to rate it below one star, that's what it would earn.<br /><br />Quaker, we love you, but send your bakers back into the test kitchen.  This one's a dud!"

I love the taste with a bit of cream and some sweetener. I love it and I drink a lot of it. I've tasted everything from high dollar gourmet blends to cheap supermarket standards just to see which I prefer the most. I'm sometimes as finicky about my coffee as a wine connoisseur is about a robust pinot noir.<br /><br />That's why, when I brewed a pot of this Puroast Low Acid Coffee and tested it, I had to get a second opinion. I hated it. It was horrible on every level. The scent of the grounds as I was preparing the pot was my first clue: not only did they not smell like any coffee I've ever smelled, but the scent was almost a burned rubber odor that, when brewing, permeated the house like day old stink.<br /><br />And then there was the taste.<br /><br />I can't speak to whether or not it does what it's purported to do - ease the sensitive stomachs of those for whom normal coffee is too acidic (which occasionally includes me, especially when I drink a cup at night). I can't speak on that because there was no way, after four or five mouthfuls, I was going to force myself to drink any more to find out. Call me crazy, but I sort of expected the coffee, low acid French Roast or not, to taste like coffee. Not like soaked sweat socks poured over radial tires. It may very well be low acid, but the aftertaste alone makes heartburn preferable.<br /><br />But I know that I'm finicky about coffee, so before I became too hasty in my rush to judgement, I secured a second opinion from my father. My father who loves coffee even more than I, but unlike myself, has never met a cup he couldn't drink, and thinks that drinking the two day old swill at the bottom of a scorched pot is better than wasting it to brew fresh. He drinks it black, likes it strong, and has been known to tolerate even my aunt's coffee...and that, for anyone who's tried it, is saying something.<br /><br />So when he poured himself a cup of this Puroast Low Acid Coffee and settled in his chair, I watched him for his reaction, expecting him to razz me for my persnickety tastes. He drank half a cup, got up, and poured the rest of the cup and the whole of the remaining pot down the drain.<br /><br />That pretty much says it all."

I got an email from Amazon stating that they had not received notification of shipping from the seller (Barry Farm). I emailed the seller, received no response. I then got an email from Amazon a day later with a delivery time frame. The product did not arrive during the stated time frame (late). When it finally arrived, I received a bag of melted goo.

I discovered them when I was in England back in 2000 and quickly became a fan.  About a year ago I picked up a bag that was on sale at my local supermarket.  I was finding it odd that they were on sale so much but took advantage of it.  After opening the bag I found the chips were not even close to the Kettle chips I was used to.  They were all uniform whitish yellow in color, flavor was way off, the lovely extra crisp brown chips were gone completely and I was very disappointed.  So I e-mailed Kettle with the following:  ""What Happened? I bought this bag of chips the other day and they have a very different taste; It tastes ""cheaper"". I don't know how else to put it... I also noticed that the chips seemed to be less cooked as I did not see any of the browner colored chips that have the most flavor. I am hoping that nothing has changed with the ingredients or process used to produce this product. Did I just get a weird batch? I have been buying only Kettle Chips for about 10 years now so I am wondering.""  I did receive a reply: ""Thanks for letting us know about your experience with your Kettle Brand¬Æ Chips. It sounds like you may have received a bag that should not have slipped by our inspections, and we apologize.Our potatoes do vary seasonally which could account for a variation in color-but our chips should still taste great!Thanks for providing us with the ""best before"" code from the bag.  This really helps when passing on your comments to our staff.<br />We are sending some coupons to replace your purchase with any of our Kettle Brand¬Æ flavors or nut butters, believing you will have a great experience with your next purchase! In case you buy this product again, we suggest avoiding the same best before date (if you still have it) in the rare instance another bag from the same case slipped by our inspections at the same time.<br />Thanks again for letting us know about this and expect the coupons to arrive within 3 weeks.  Please let me know if I can be of any more help.""  Well the next bag was good.  Since that time I have picked up 3 bags of chips all were like the ""bad"" bag so I am pretty sure that they have changed there product to reduce cost.  I did some research and found out that Kettle was bought out by a private equity company.  So the same cookie cutter management processes are probably being employed at Kettle.  Acquire company with high quality brand recognition, sell product to mass merchants, lower quality/cost of product to increase margin and finally sell company just before the customer base starts to realize that the brand is no longer a quality brand.  increased profits make the company more valuable on paper so they make a nice profit for the investors. Customer and employees lose out of course as does an unsuspecting buyer of the exploited brand.  Stay away from Kettle chips they are no longer the same..."

However because they are so highly compressed they are deadly. There is an overwhelming amount of research that proves they are not digestible, and do not break down. Numerous dogs have died from chocking and internal blockages. Luckily this was brought to my attention before I purchased any.<br /><br />It really doesn't matter how much your dogs like them, statistically you dog would have an excellent chance of becoming seriously injured or worse.<br /><br />If keeping your dog busy is the goal try a kong or a ""busy ball"". My dogs play with their kong and similar toys for hours or until they are too tired to play anymore. Additionally some busy balls let you record a message that is played when the ball is moved, even slightly, which also helps with separation anxiety.<br /><br />If you want to treat your dog to something in the way of food, almost anything you can think of is safer than a greenie.<br /><br />Also please note....there are many greenie knockoffs. If the treat is shaped and molded or looks like plastic, has fine details showing the company name or other designs, it is in fact a molded treat. Anything this highly compressed is absolutely deadly.<br /><br />While even rawhide carries some of the same risks because it is so durable...it is a MUCH safer alternative to greenies.<br /><br />I am actually surprised amazon even sells this product, and would go as far as suggesting to amazon users to petition them to stop selling it."

The first night, I filled 3 gel capsules with the tincture and went to bed and felt NO EFFECTS WHATSOEVER!  If anything, I remembered less dreams than I usually do on any given night and had more disturbed sleep.  I had read another review about this herb requiring more of it to perhaps experience lucid dreaming... Emboldened by the fact that I wasn't allergic to it, I measured out 20ml and this time drank an over the counter sleep drink that contained melatonin with it and went to bed after 45 minutes... Nothing. Again. Waking up in the middle of the night over and over again with no dream recall which is LESS than my day to day.<br /><br />So, I figured that maybe it has a reverse tolerance...So the third night, I took 30ml on a mostly empty stomach...By now, the taste didn't bother me as I have been used to tinctures before and this is by far not the worst. I had noticed some muscle soreness the nights before and started to get some of this this night as well...Still, no dream recall; and this coming from someone who recalls a dream daily.  Some sleep disturbance but not tired because of it...So much for third time's the charm...<br /><br />I waited for a few days and figured one last go around; a fourth time...I had dreams that I recalled on the days without it in between the third time and the fourth time...I tried 30ml again and on mostly an empty stomach...Not only no dream recall but woke up earlier than I normally do...I don't feel overly tired from waking but certainly no dream recall, much less any lucid dreaming...<br /><br />This may work for some folks, but at price over $30, with no return policy and the bottle more than half gone, I am disappointed thoroughly.

When we opened the box, the truffles were puckered, and chocolate was inside of the ends of the wrappers.  Some so badly (about 27-28), that I could not put them into the candy jar to take to the venue. The rest were still puckered with indentations on them. But I tried to pick the least worst ones. I opened some up to see how they taste because of the bad quality of them, in wrapped form. They did taste amazing as usual. What an embarrassment at a $30,000 plus venue. I sent an email to Sue""s Shirt Shop and More (seller through Amazon). They informed me that they were perfect at time of shipment, but wanted the order number. On October 3, I provided them the info and told them they were by far not perfect when received, that I did not have them in any heat (that I was home at time of delivery) and wondered how could they tell me they were in perfect condition at time of shipment unless they themselves physically inspected each one. As of this date, I have not heard back. I do know that we paid $10.98 for shipping and handling and would think that USPS was not responsible for their condition; however, only Amazon.com would know that. The issue of shipping never came up. But in the end, the customer (us) got the shaft. For the price we paid, we could have bought each piece individually in a local shop. Unfortunately, we did not know this would happen. I would never order these again, online. We did it because it was the only way to buy boxes of them.  omg, I have now first read other reviews and find that ours, too, did not have the shiny, crisp covering that they normally have. And, yes, there were chocolate stains on the inside of the box they came in. Just like in other orders. I now see that I am not alone in having the problems of quality being far under par. I just wish mine would have been of the correct quality so that it didn't leave a bad impression on the candy table at our daughter's wedding, which was otherwise elegant. Then again, hopefully, it reflected on the quality of Lindor truffles themselves. All I know is that someone should be very concerned. I feel like these were the rejects of their product.

It is not drinkable plain.  Which I suppose is why people require all sorts of recipes adding sugar, or spices, anything to give this tea some flavor and take away the horrid bitterness.<br /><br />I think it's even worse than the bagged lipton tea if that is possible.  In the bagged tea, they don't put dust in the teabags because it would fall right out of the bag, but since this is loose tea, lipton saw fit to add dust, twigs, anything but the actual leaves.<br /><br />What should you drink?  Anything you like.  I suggest browsing this site called the English Tea Store (no affiliation) just to get an idea about what types of teas it is possible to purchase.<br /><br />I astounds me that anyone could drink this substance and call it ""tea"".  It is not tea, it is particles of bitterness, dust, pieces of twigs, black and tasteless leavings of what used to be a tea plant.<br /><br />What the hell is wrong with you people, to drink this stuff.  By the way I have nothing against some lipton tea, but when you drink this stuff you need to add lemon, sugar, or cream, something because it is awful stuff trying to drink it on its own.<br /><br />If you have to buy tea at a supermarket, try the twinings darjeeling that's a decent blend you can drink."

It is a failure in several ways. If you pop for even as short as 2 1/2 minutes, you will get about 50% good kernals, and the rest will be burnt. And I mean individual burnt kernals and a few solid masses of burnt kernals fused together! I have popped three bags so far and the result has been the same for all three. And I stood next to the microwave listening, as the product advises. At 2 1/2 minutes, there was still plenty of popping going on, but I stopped anyway.<br /><br />Then comes the challenge of opening the bag. The instructions are somewhat clear, but I was scratching my head on the first one or two that I popped. When you attempt to pull off the plastic bowl cover, you must pull very hard, and when you do that, the paper attached to the plastic tears and popcorn spills out. I tried pulling one side, but it didn't open cleanly, so I tried the other side, with the same result. I was determined not to use scissors because I didn't want greasy scissors that I would have to clean. I ended up on all three bags eating the popcorn with the plastic cover still partially attached. It was clear that any more attempts to remove the cover would have meant popcorn on the counter and floor.<br /><br />Finally, the picture on the box showing a nice buttery yellow bag of popcorn overflowing the top of the bowl is blatant false advertising. On all three bags I popped - at the proper time and temperature - the result was some yellow kernals, some grayish kernals (on their way to being burnt), and black, burnt kernals. And each time, the amount of popcorn was at least two inches below the top of the bowl. And many kernals were not popped.<br /><br />If an industrial design student presented this pop-up bowl for a class assignment, I think they would get an A minus for idea, and a D minus for execution.

Well I gotta say this tastes horrible. I have been drinking mate for a long time as I lived in Argentina, and this tastes nothing like normal mate. I understand the idea behind this mate, and the better health reasons behind having it unsmoked and organic, which organic and unsmoked sounds like an amazing idea, especially since I prefer organic everything! The problem is that this mate tastes nothing like normal mate, and really doesn't have a good taste. There are a lot of Americans who when they drink mate out of a gourd and bombilla who think that it tastes like dirt. Well this mate is definitely a dirt earthy taste. It tastes nothing like a good crop of mate, this is highly agreed by my Argentinian friend who ended up throwing his purchase in the garbage just after 2 gourds full, and eventually I tried to struggle through this yerba, but in the end it was just too much for me. Waste of money, and the many Argentinians that are friends of the family want to stay away from this mate, when even they would prefer to drink organic as well. Sorry eco teas, but your crafty wording, and healthy image doesn't always mean it is good. I mean just because you have a pretty label, and you take out all the stalk from your teas does not mean they are truly better. The stalk is fundamentally part of yerba mate, as an image and why waste the other part of the plant right? For an alternative to smoked mate and non organic there are better ones out there...."

I am asking Amazon for a refund - otherwise, they are going in the trash unused.<br /><br />Copied from FDA web site.<br /><br />FDA Continues to Caution Dog Owners About Chicken Jerky Products<br />November 18, 2011<br /><br />The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is again cautioning consumers that chicken jerky products for dogs (also sold as chicken tenders, strips or treats) may be associated with illness in dogs. In the last 12 months, FDA has seen an increase in the number of complaints it received of dog illnesses associated with consumption of chicken jerky products imported from China. These complaints have been reported to FDA by dog owners and veterinarians.<br /><br />FDA issued a cautionary warning regarding chicken jerky products to consumers in September 2007 and a Preliminary Animal Health Notification in December of 2008. After seeing the number of complaints received drop off during the latter part of 2009 and most of 2010, the FDA is once again seeing the number of complaints rise to the levels of concern that prompted release of our earlier warnings.<br /><br />Chicken jerky products should not be substituted for a balanced diet and are intended to be fed occasionally in small quantities.<br /><br />FDA is advising consumers who choose to feed their dogs chicken jerky products to watch their dogs closely for any or all of the following signs that may occur within hours to days of feeding the products: decreased appetite; decreased activity; vomiting; diarrhea, sometimes with blood; increased water consumption and/or increased urination. If the dog shows any of these signs, stop feeding the chicken jerky product. Owners should consult their veterinarian if signs are severe or persist for more than 24 hours. Blood tests may indicate kidney failure (increased urea nitrogen and creatinine). Urine tests may indicate Fanconi syndrome (increased glucose). Although most dogs appear to recover, some reports to the FDA have involved dogs that have died.<br /><br />FDA, in addition to several animal health diagnostic laboratories in the U.S., is working to determine why these products are associated with illness in dogs. FDA's Veterinary Laboratory Response Network (VLRN) is now available to support these animal health diagnostic laboratories. To date, scientists have not been able to determine a definitive cause for the reported illnesses. FDA continues extensive chemical and microbial testing but has not identified a contaminant.<br /><br />The FDA continues to actively investigate the problem and its origin. Many of the illnesses reported may be the result of causes other than eating chicken jerky. Veterinarians and consumers alike should report cases of animal illness associated with pet foods to the FDA Consumer Complaint Coordinator in their state or go to [...]"

Price Foundation.  I've just completed some research on their site, and others, and discovered some disturbing facts about this so called agave nectar.  It has a quite dark history.  Type ""agave"" into their search engine and you'll find a number of articles/reports.

It was a bad idea. The poor puppy got very sick after eating a Greenie. He vomited and had diarrhea.<br /><br />I took him to urgent care and the Vet's verdict(informed on the X-ray)was: ""a Greenie got stocked in his intestine"".<br /><br />I was very lucky to get the puppy recovered with medicine. But surgery was being considered by the Vet (mind about $7,000). On the worst case scenario, my puppy could have died because his intestinal system was obstructed for 3-4 days.<br /><br />After this unfortunate incident, I looked-up for reviews about this unsafe product -and not to be surprised- I found several concerning stories like mine. I also learned that few dog owners have sued Greenies because they believe it was the reason that provoked an obstruction to their pets digestive system, sadly resulting on death. ""Roughly 315 million Greenies were sold last year, but the breath-freshening treats have been blamed for at least 13 pet deaths and more than two dozen complaints have been filed with the Feds"". Dogster-com<br /><br />Note that as the product label says: Greenies are not 100% digestible, and if you read with more attention, the label has a Warning saying that: dogs may get sick or even chock when ingesting a Greenie!<br /><br />At the end of the day, it's hard to believe that there are companies like Grennies that don't address these issues, and just care about marketing and profiting -not so much about producing a healthy, safe treat for our best buddies.<br /><br />In any case, I'd recommend to ask your Vet or read more dog owners reviews before giving Greenies to your dog."

The bottom of the cup is covered with it and you get to drink the dust as well.<br /><br />Even then, it is possible to get a decent tea from dustings (from The Book of Tea) but not with this stuff. It makes a weak, thin tea, no mater how long you steep it.<br /><br />There was not a single tea leaf in the first package I opened and spread out to look at after I got over the shock of having a bag of dust, just a couple small pieces and a lot of dustings.<br /><br />Hence, I really wonder about the other reviews, meaning what I got is NOT what they got, but it is what Amazon shipped to me. This stuff is junk.<br /><br />By the way, I have 12 different loose teas in the house at any time, with Keemun generally my favorite and Kenilworth my favorite Ceylon.

They are back to running the fenceline, greeting visitors, etc. - and not as sickly as they had become - aka the lethergic, diarreha, lost weight crew I was faced with.<br /><br />I know there are a bunch of pros and cons out there on various websites concerning Canidae - and I use to be one of the biggest 'flag wavers' for Canidae....until the formula change and the Vet expenses I was forced to face.  Believe me - with a very heavy heart I cannot recommend Canidae any more.  I do not do this with a flare of being noticed on the Internet, any vindications against the company, or any personnal gain...just a great concern for the illnesses I've experienced with my 'pack' (5+ dogs).  It took several months (under Vet care & dry dog food changes) for my dogs to recover, and I don't want to see any other 'beloved family members' undergo what I've/we've gone through.  Please, please, PLEASE check out [...] (a highly recommended (non-bias)dog food analysis site).  They are still recommending Canidae ALS as a 5-Star (6 star being the highest rating) premium food to feed - with the caveate 'However, from a position of being a product about which DFA heard very few complaints, the number of animals we hear of that do not do well on this food appears to have risen substantially.'<br /><br />All I ask is do your own personal research concerning this food, keep an eye on your pet's food reactions, and make the best 'educated' decision for your beloved 'four footed/furry' family members."

Ropey,"As a warning - I am not a vegan, I do not hug trees (though I do love them), and I really am not into the whole organic movement (though I have no problem with it).... If my stance on those three ""issues"" was different, I might love this product... as it is, I found it to be somewhat disgusting.<br /><br />I typically drink Meijer branded chocolate shake mix (Meijer is a western US mega-store & the shake mix is a knock-off of what slimfast puts in a can).  I hoped that this mix would taste at least somewhat (even a little bit) like the meijer brand.... The ways that I described this taste to my wife each morning... well, they aren't good... I'm listing a few:<br /><br />- It tasted like rope<br />- It tasted like licking a wet horses bridle<br />- It tasted like sucking the water out of a wet hemp bracelet<br />- It tasted like someone had mixed dirt in with my unsweetened baker's cocoa<br />- It tasted like chewing on tree bark<br /><br />In all seriousness, the ""rope"" & ""wet hemp bracelet"" analogies are the closest... I used to wear a lot of hemp (before doing so was part of the ""organic"" eating movement I guess?)... and I remember chewing on the necklace/bracelets.  This product tastes just like that.<br /><br />Another note - I was not impressed by the blending of this stuff.  Most shake mixes actually dissolve in liquid; this stuff just sorta clumped into the liquid.<br /><br />On the other hand, I ate (almost) all of it... and it was much more palatable once I mixed it in with the meijer shake mix (2 parts meijer mix, 1 part this stuff).  The fiber content is really high (always a plus).. and it was fairly reasonable.<br /><br />So, if you are into the earth loving hipster movement or are just a standard faire hippy - this stuff might be for you.  For Joe Six-pack (even the liberal type), this product should probably be avoided."

My cats did eat this food, but after reading the ingredients I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my cats. The first three ingredients are (which indicates the most prevalent ingredients) are chicken by-product meal, corn gluten meal, and ground yellow corn. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. Basically, corn is just a filler and causes pets to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more (more for us to clean in the litter box), and retain less nutrients. Most inexpensive low-quality foods have lots of these fillers and cheap ingredients with little to no nutritional value. The only meat in Meow Mix at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful cat food. I suppose you get what you pay for. I recommend to stay far away from Meow Mix, as it is simply a very low quality food. Even though the price is quite inexpensive, your cat will actually eat more than if you paid for a better quality food, because they will never feel full. Cats need to eat meat, and there just isn't real meat in this food. High-quality foods tend to be more nutritionally dense, meaning you will be feeding a much smaller amount for the same number of calories. If you do the math to figure out the cost for the number of calories you need to feed your pet, many premium foods are CHEAPER than the awful crap you're buying at the grocery store. When purchasing a cat (or dog) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself- provided that you eat a typical (non vegetarian or other restricted) diet. Now that I know what to look for, I usually buy my pets all natural foods such as Blue Buffalo, Halo, Wellness or Natural Balance. All of those brands contain real, whole meats that I myself would eat, with no added fillers or corn."

This ingredient, when combined with ascorbic acid (vitamin C) creates Benzene which is carcinogenic (cancer causing).<br /><br />I used to use Splenda or generic sucralose packets, but they made a mess on the counter, took up too much room in our pantry when purchased in bulk, and took up alot of space near the coffee maker when compared with concentrated sweeteners. EZ sweet would be the easy alternative if it weren't toxic. I had to find a better option. I find that the only super easy way around using EZ sweet but also save on space/mess is to use the splenda mini tablets. They are pricey and will cost a lot more than the packets, so I've recently found another option. I can now purchase 1 oz of pure sucralose powder form from the Splendex site and mix it with 3 oz of water to make the equivalent of 2,500 packets of Splenda. The cost of the 1oz powder is only $24.95. I found that other companies sell sucralose powder and if you buy a lot of it, it's even cheaper. I don't know how I would measure out 1oz to make a 4 oz bottle of sweetener solution so, for me, it's just easier to get 1oz, it will last us a while and the 4oz bottle on the coffee counter doesn't take up much space at all. I'm going to experiment with different natural preservatives (colloidal silver, GSE, natural salts, citric acid) to keep the solution from becoming contaminated with bacteria or fungus. If you're going to go this route, do some research on natural preservatives and if you find one you love, please leave a comment to this review.<br /><br />Note: I was lucky that the splendex company agreed to give me a 4oz bottle to use for my sucralose solution, I'm not sure if they would do that for everyone. If not, just keep your old EZ squeeze bottle or find a nice dropper bottle that will do the job without making a mess. Oh and finding the powder wasn't easy. It is not an option on their home/default web page. I had to go to order products and on the right side was an option for the powder."

10005,B000P41A28,A3A6QXIC8XCOJG,Vladimir Dyo,9,20,1,1231804800,Constipation!!!!!,"We breastfeed our month old boy, but since his bilirubin level was still high, doctors recommended to switch to formula for 48 hours. We started with Similac Advance (Shield Plus) which we still had from hospital. First 24 hours were wonderful in terms of pooping, then we decided to switch to Similac Organic for known reasons, but during the first 32-Ounce Bottle I began to notice that his stool was getting harder, and eventually he stopped pooing (actually he produced two stone-ball like poops) and had a hard time for another 24 hours. Breast milk and Similac advance tested similarly sweet, but Similac Organic was much much less sweet. I made a research on the internet and I found the following that may help you to understand the cause of constipation: (http://www.drhull.com/EncyMaster/C/constipation_infant.html)<br /><br />Constipation means infrequent, hard stools. It does not mean grunting or straining, although your baby may certainly exhibit these behaviors when having a bowel movement. So the first question to ask is, ""Is my child really constipated?""<br /><br />Next, consider why true constipation - excessively hard, dry stools - arises. The normal function of the colon is to remove water from the stool. Otherwise we would rapidly dehydrate and die. That is why severe diarrhea is dangerous - the stool is moving through the colon and being expelled from the body so fast, there is no time to properly reabsorb the stool water back into the bloodstream.<br /><br />Conversely, if the fecal material remains in the colon too long, the water removal process may extract too much of the fecal water and leave the stool mass excessively dry and hard. It is just that simple.<br /><br />So constipation arises when feces remain in the colon too long because:<br /><br />  * the colon is naturally sluggish (has decreased ""motility,"" we say)<br />  * a low residue diet produces insufficient stimulation to the colon to trigger its normal propulsive activity and clear out the feces<br />  * a combination of the above two factors<br />  * there is obstruction of the lower GI tract<br />  o functional neurologic - the lower rectum and anus cannot properly relax to allow evacuation - Hirschprung disease<br />  o functional anatomic - anal-rectal positioning doesn't allow easy evacuation<br />  o mechanical - a tumor physically blocks stool passage<br /><br />Breast fed babies are essentially never truly constipated. This is because breast milk is such a low residue diet. Almost all of the milk is absorbed by the baby and used. The stools consist of a small amount of unabsorbed protein curds and a large amount of bowel secretions, chiefly mucus. And of course a lot of noisy gas. But these infrequent stools do not indicate constipation - just infrequent stools.<br /><br />Later, when breast feeding infants start solids, they technically can become constipated, but it is unusual in my experience. It is not until the child is pretty much on solids and especially when weaned to whole cow milk that constipation is much of an issue. By then we are really discussing toddlers.<br /><br />Breast fed infants do tend to save up after the first few months and poop less often. This worries some parents. Despite reassurances to the contrary, some folks just have to see a poop every day from their little darling to be happy and fulfilled. Go figure. They forget that stool can stay in the colon for a very, very long time and it will not hurt anything.<br /><br />When the stool hoarding breast feeder does finally get ready to go, another problem comes to the fore: grunting and straining. When the baby's rectum forms in utero, it is in a state of permanent contraction for nigh onto nine months. The baby does not pass the meconium (fetal stool) in utero until perhaps right at the end of gestation right before, during or after delivery. Until the baby is several months old, and has passed and been stretched by quite a few bowel movements, the rectum and particularly the anus may be quite tight and resist easy dilation to allow the stool to pass. Because the baby has weak, flabby abdominal musculature (that is why his little tummy is so poochy), he must push against this tight anal spincter with his diaphragm. Just as Mom pushed during delivery, and with seemingly equal discomfort. Hence the grunting and red-faced straining.<br /><br />  The other major problem of both breast or bottle fed newborns which creates this sort of straining is dyschezia, or uncoordinated stooling.<br /><br />The cure for the problem of a tight anus is pretty simple: a gentle rectal exam with a well-lubricated pinky finger by the doctor (which should be done on all babies with stooling troubles anyway to rule out a physical obstruction) will be both diagnostic and curative. If one such gentle dilation doesn't do the trick, I have Mom bring the baby back in a week and repeat the procedure. The anal spincter is stretched, and pretty soon, no more terrible straining.<br />Top<br /><br />Bottle fed infants are ""a whole 'nother story."" Infant formulas are not nearly as well digested as breast milk, and leave quite a bit more residue in the colon. (The exception to this rule in my mind is the new Similac¬Æ that really does seem to leave the stools about the same consistency as breast milk.) So true constipation in bottle fed infants is much more common; my feeling is that soy formulas are even worse than cow milk based formulas in this regard.<br /><br />The young infant's colon is simply not designed for all the residue and stool bulk. The residue builds up, is dried too much, and becomes hard, pebbly stool. It is naturally difficult and uncomfortable for the baby to pass.<br /><br />The addition of cereal to the diet only compounds whatever problems already exist. Cereal + milk = concrete. Cereal in the formula bottle seems to be especially bad, probably because parents don't realise just how much cereal the baby is getting.<br />Top<br /><br />Treatment of constipation mainly involves common sense diet modifications and sometimes medication:<br /><br />  * Again, as with breast fed babies, a search for the cause of the constipation and gentle rectal exam can work wonders.<br />  * I use a lot of Karo¬Æ corn syrup for bottle feeders with constipation. It is my first choice recomendation; it almost always works if used properly. Unfortunately, many doctors and nurses don't use it properly, get poor results, and don't recommend it as often as they should. I start with two measuring teaspoons in every formula bottle, regardless of size, and adjust the dose up or down depending on how things are going. Usually, the baby can be weaned off the Karo pretty soon, but may need to stay on it periodically for the first few months of life. It is very important to put the corn syrup in the formula and not give it in between in water. The excess corn syrup does not get digested very well - the baby is already digesting all the sugar he can from the formula. The excess sugar passes down to the colon and produces a sugar diarrhea similar to sorbitol (as below, prunes, apple juice).<br /><br />  Before scolding me about ""the risk of botulism"" from corn syrup, please see:<br /><br />  Clinical Pediatric Emergency Medicine, Volume 4,Number 3,September 2003: ""Pediatric neurologic potpourri: cases to remember""<br /><br />  ""In the past, C. botulinum was also found in corn syrup, but this is no longer a risk factor for infant botulism because of a recent change in the processing formula.""<br /><br />  For the complete source of statement, see: Olsen SJ, Swerdlow DL. Risk of infant botulism from corn syrup. In reply. Pediatr Infect Dis J 2000;19:584-5.<br /><br />  * Certain fruits and juices - for example prunes, apple juice, apricots - are rich in sorbitol, a nondigestible sugar that passes through the body to the colon and causes water to be retained or drawn into the stool mass. They can be increased in the diet to loosen the stool and relieve or prevent constipation.<br />  * Lactulose is a non-absorbable sugar product that is processed by colon bacteria to produce an inflow of water into the stool mass. We use it a lot - it seems to be a favorite of our local pediatric gastroenterologists. The dose is adjusted up or down according to respose. Side effects are usually not serious but can include cramping or diarrhea - obviously, stop the medicine and call your doctor if these occur.<br />  * Glycerine suppositories are helpful to relieve your child if there is some hard stool that just won't come out easily. The suppository melts in the heat of the rectum and lubricates the stool. Glycerine also has a mild effect of attracting water into the stool, which softens it. The act of insertion also serves to stimulate the rectum and anus to initiate the defecation reflex. (Glycerine is completely safe - it is a food, found in candy, not a drug.)<br />  * Fiber containing foods are helpful for older children and adults, but are not really of much use in the treatment of young infant constipation, for dietary reasons: babies just don't eat a lot of fiber. (I believe ISoyalac¬Æ, which was a high fiber soy formula, has been discontinued. It was never very available any place I practiced, anyway.)<br /><br />Top<br /><br />Myths and misconceptions concerning infant constipation:<br /><br />  * Iron in the formula causes constipation. No way. I can understand lay people thinking this to be the case because when adults take iron preparations (in large doses) they may become constipated. But the tiny amount present in infant formula is not nearly enough to cause any problems.<br /><br />  The irritating thing to me is to hear doctors and nurses who should know better repeating this nonsense and switching the infants to the less healthy low- or no-iron formulas.<br /><br />  * Increasing water in the diet is commonly recommended; it makes very little sense and demonstrates a failure to reflect on the basic physiologic cause of the overdry stool. The problem is too little water retention in the stool, not too little water in the body! Unless there is increased fiber or some chemical substance such as a sugar (Karo¬Æ, lactulose) to retain the water in the stool, excess water will simply wind up in the diaper as urine.<br /><br />Top"

My dog hardly touched the stuff, and then I looked at the ingredients: one of the first things on it was corn-a grain known to cause allergies in dogs. As a matter of fact, corn might be the most allergy-prone food amongst dogs. Not to mention, thanks to our friends at Monsanto, it is almost always Genetically modified (GMO) or a franken-food, unless it's organic. Real ""premium"" dog foods brag that they've no corn.<br /><br />Right at the top of the list of ingredients is chicken-by-products, another no-no among real ""premium"" dog foods. This means all the waste that it is usually thrown out from the chicken since it's not real meat. Cheap dog foods put this in their food simply because it's cheap, but it's not real meat. A little further down you will notice BHA, an artificial preservative, which again real ""premium"" dog foods do not have.<br /><br />In short, BilJac is a joke. It is basically, insanely overpriced Alpo, with no organic ingredients whatsoever, and uses all the shortcuts, filler, and chemistry that the cheapest dog foods on the market use. Don't be fooled by the old-fashioned appeal of the company's 60 years in business. There is nothing but modern chemistry in the bag, and all the folksy appeal will not make up for cheap, lousy ingredients. I ended up buying Blue Buffalo Wilderness and I have not looked back."

My number one love is green tea ... specifically Japanese Sencha. I have consumed many grades and types of steaming (mild, medium and ""deep""). I have also tried many of the products offered by ""Two Leaves and a Bud"" by way of Whole Foods (who do not offer this).<br /><br />This is the first offering by Two Leaves that I sadly have to say is dreadful. Before you think I'm a jerk, let me say that they offer some awesome bagged teas. This just isn't one of them (IMHO).<br /><br />The orange that they add KILLS all of the beauty that the Sencha could potentially offer. What's worse is they suggest a steeping time of 4-minutes. Ludicrous. Most mild steamed (which this is) or medium steamed Sencha's steep for no more than 3-minutes. Four minutes will produce an acrid bitter brew unless the Sencha is a superior grade (which this doesn't appear to be).<br /><br />Even after steeping this for about 3 minutes, the taste is still overwhelmingly sharp & ""bitty"" (just a weaker sharp). I can not believe that the people at Two Leaves have ever had a good cup of loose leaf Sencha. I can't. If they have, they wouldn't offer this.<br /><br />I can only assume they add so much orange to it because the Sencha grade is poor. Otherwise, why not sell it without the orange flavor like the wonderful <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FGZKWM"">Two Leaves and a Bud, Tamayokucha Extremely Green Tea, Tea Bags, 100 Count</a> they offer? The Tamayokucha is excellent! No orange flavor needed, and I bet none is needed here either.<br /><br />Bummer is that I was dumb enough to buy the 100 count box (my bad). There is no way I can drink the rest of it and I would feel horrible if I gave it away to someone. They would think I had no taste in teas.<br /><br />My advice: buy a single box of this first. If you like it, switch to coffee."
